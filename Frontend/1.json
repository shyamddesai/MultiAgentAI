        "Title": "Asia's first half crude oil imports slip, undermining bullish forecasts - Reuters.com",
        "Source": "Reuters",
        "Date": "Mon, 01 Jul 2024",
        "Content": "Asia's crude oil imports in the first half of 2024 were slightly lower than the same period in 2023, totaling 27.16 million barrels per day (bpd), down by 130,000 bpd from 27.29 million bpd. The decline was mainly due to reduced imports by China, the world's largest oil importer, which could not be offset by increased imports by India. This decline challenges the bullish demand forecasts by major industry groups such as the IEA and OPEC. OPEC's June report expected China's oil demand to grow by 720,000 bpd in 2024, while the IEA forecasted a 500,000 bpd increase. However, China's actual imports in the first half fell by 300,000 bpd from the previous year. India's crude oil imports increased to 4.94 million bpd, a modest rise of 90,000 bpd from the previous year. However, this increase was insufficient to meet OPEC's forecast for India's demand growth. The overall demand forecast for Asia by OPEC is an increase of 1.3 million bpd in 2024, while IEA expects a 900,000 bpd rise. The slow growth in imports casts doubt on the region's ability to meet these forecasts, especially with the expectation that oil prices will remain above $80 per barrel, necessitating robust economic growth to drive higher crude demand."

        "Source": "The Hindu BusinessLine",
        "Date": "Tue, 02 Jul 2024",
        "Content": "India's crude oil imports from Russia surged to a 12-month high of 1.97 million bpd in June 2024, driven by reduced cargoes to China. This represents a 15% month-on-month increase and a 2% year-on-year rise. Public refiners imported 1.10 million bpd, a 12-month high, while private refiners imported a record 871,200 bpd. The increase in imports from Russia was partly due to lower shipments from traditional suppliers like Iraq and Saudi Arabia. India's overall crude imports remained robust at 4.62 million bpd. However, imports from Iraq fell by 20% month-on-month and 3.5% year-on-year, while imports from Saudi Arabia dropped by 36% month-on-month and 46% year-on-year. Crude oil shipments from the US continued to rise, reaching 331,000 bpd in June, up from 224,000 bpd in May."
