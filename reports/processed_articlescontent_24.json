"US natural gas pipeline ADCC begins commercial operations US natural gas pipeline ADCC begins commercial operations July 12 (Reuters) - Infrastructure firm WhiteWater said on Friday the ADCC pipeline in South Texas started commercial service on July 1, amid surging U.S. liquefied natural gas exports to global markets. The 40-mile pipeline has a capacity to transport about 1.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas to the Cheniere Corpus Christi Liquefaction facility from Whistler Pipeline's Agua Dulce Header in South Texas.

The U.S. is forecast to export a record 12.2 bcfd of natural gas this year. It became the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023 and has stayed ahead of recent leaders Australia and Qatar. WhiteWater said the pipeline provides Cheniere direct access to Permian and Eagle Ford volumes in addition to volumes sourced along the Gulf Coast.
