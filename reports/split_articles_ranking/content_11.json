The 40-mile pipeline transports natural gas from Whistler Pipeline's Agua Dulce Header to Cheniere's Corpus Christi Liquefaction facility in Texas. The pipeline is capable of providing approximately 1.7 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of natural gas transportation capacity to the Cheniere Corpus Christi Liquefaction facility from markets on Whistler Pipeline's Agua Dulce Header in South Texas. The receipt points in Agua Dulce provide Cheniere direct access to Permian and Eagle Ford volumes in addition to volumes sourced along the Gulf Coast. The ADCC Pipeline further enhances the natural gas infrastructure in Texas and creates an additional demand point for Permian gas. Further, the infrastructure supports U.S. LNG exports to global markets. The ADCC Pipeline is a joint venture owned 70 percent by Whistler Pipeline LLC, which is a joint venture between WhiteWater, MPLX LP, and Enbridge - and 30 percent by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cheniere Energy. WhiteWater is an Austin, Texas-based infrastructure company and operator of the Whistler Pipeline. The Whistler Pipeline is an approximately 450-mile, 42-inch intrastate pipeline that transports natural gas from the Waha Header in the Permian Basin to Agua Dulce, Texas, providing direct access to South Texas and export markets. An approximately 50-mile 36-inch lateral provides connectivity to the Midland Basin. \u00ab Arizona regulators laud largest utilities for successfully meeting higher electricity demands NREL researchers say offshore wind turbines offer path for clean hydrogen production >> Connect with Us Podcast Have an idea for our new podcast?
