On July 8, the field's production began flowing to the Mellitah oil port through the 250 km Al-Feel - Mellitah oil pipeline. In May 2024, state-owned Mellitah Oil and Gas and Nafusa Oil Operations signed an agreement for the transport, handling, and shipment of crude oil via the Al-Feel - Mellitah pipeline and completed a new shipping line. Production from the field will gradually increase, reaching 8,000 barrels per day by mid-July and 10,000 barrels per day by next August. Over the past few months, NOC has been revitalizing and rehabilitating several production sites with the goal of achieving a production rate of 2 million barrels per day by 2030.
