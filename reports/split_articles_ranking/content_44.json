The result was within the expected range, and included a bearish revision for the prior week, limiting support for Nymex futures. Expand Ahead of the 12 p.m. ET print, the August futures contract was up 2.0 cents at $2.455/MMBtu. The prompt month ticked lower to $2.452 when the EIA data was released, a day early because of the Fourth of July holiday. About 20 minutes later, the contract stood at $2.456, up 2.1 cents from Tuesday's settlement. Prior to the report, NGI modeled a 29 Bcf build. Early estimates to Reuters ranged from builds of 13 Bcf to 76 Bcf, with an average increase of 41 Bcf. The five-year average build was 69 Bcf for the week, while a year ago it was 76 Bcf.
