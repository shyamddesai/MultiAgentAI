China used to import more than a third of its oil supplies from Africa but by 2022, that figure had dropped to about one-tenth, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), an online data platform. According to Carnegie's report entitled 'How Is China's Economic Transition Affecting its Relations with Africa?', between 2019 and 2023, there were dramatic increases in China's imports of oil from Malaysia (408%), the UAE (254%), Kazakhstan (214%) and Kuwait (41%). By contrast, during the same period, all eight major African oil producers, except Chad, earned much less than they did before the pandemic, according to the report. Angola has fallen down the list from being China's No. 2 source of crude oil a decade ago to the eighth place in the ranking today. The sharp declines in China's oil imports from Angola, but also South Sudan (77%), Sudan (67%) and Nigeria (61%), for example, have been due to a number of factors, observers say, including geopolitical considerations, lack of investment in equipment and new oil fields and domestic political problems. As China's oil imports from Africa decline, it is increasingly turning to the more predictable production infrastructure of the Gulf countries and Russia and other Asian countries, according to the report from the Washington-based think tank.

Chinese economic data, including disappointing GDP growth and declining refinery output, raises concerns about oil demand. The focus shifts from supply concerns in the US to demand worries in China. Technical analysis suggests potential for a triple bottom pattern in oil prices, with key support and resistance levels identified. Most Read: The Week Ahead - ECB Spotlight as Fed Rate Speculations Drive Market Shifts Oil prices remained resilient this morning following a turbulent weekend. An attack on US Presidential hopeful Donald Trump has seen the US Dollar start the week on the front foot but Oil prices have held firm. Data out of China this morning stoked fears around demand once more, something which market participants had hoped was in the rearview mirror. The overall fundamental picture remains largely positive but demand concerns may hamper any further gains in the short-term. Chinese Data China's GDP data released this morning was disappointing as sluggish domestic demand bites. The data prompted several investment banks to lower their GDP forecasts. GDP growth slowed to 0.7% quarter-on-quarter (q/q) seasonally adjusted (SA) in Q2, down from 1.6% q/q in Q1 and below market expectations of 0.9%, impacted by slower retail sales growth. Domestic demand and consumer confidence remain weak, with the NBS also attributing the slowdown to extreme weather events and flooding. Although industrial output growth is cooling, it exceeded market expectations, highlighting the uneven nature of China's recovery. Strong exports are supporting manufacturing activity, with shipments rising 8.6% year-on-year (y/y) in June, up from 7.6% in May. The secondary industry, which includes manufacturing and construction, grew by 5.6% y/y in Q2, down from 6.0% in Q1, while the tertiary industry, or services, increased by 4.2%, down from 5.0%. Chinese GDP Q2 YoY Source: LSEG (click to enlarge) Chinese refinery output declined for the third consecutive month due to planned maintenance and weak fuel demand, leading independent plants to reduce production. Output for the first half of the year was down 0.4% compared to the same period last year, indicating a sluggish economic recovery and reduced processing profits for refineries. Crude oil imports for the month of June dropped 11% while H1 imports were down 2.3% YoY. According to the IEA the Chinese share of global oil demand growth is declining to 40% this year from last year's 70%. This decline in China has reignited worries about demand, a notable shift from the past two weeks where supply concerns were prevalent in the US. The Week Ahead Oil inventory data is very important as the US and Europe are currently in the middle of summer. This period is typically the peak driving season in the US, leading to high demand for petroleum and other oil-related products. Due to the busy summer season in the US, there is a good chance that weekly oil inventories will decrease more than expected. This could help keep oil prices strong and prevent any significant long-term price drops. Geopolitics also remains a concern and could once more play an important role in the absence of high impact US economic data.

(click to enlarge) Technical Analysis Oil prices snapped a four week winning streak to close around 2.33% lower. The weekly timeframe has price testing the 100-day MA which could prove to be a stern area of resistance. The daily timeframe is even more interesting as it appears markets could be setting up a triple bottom pattern. Such a pattern would no doubt embolden bulls eyeing further appreciation in oil prices. A daily candle close below the 85.25 handle opens up a potential selloff in Brent crude with support levels at 83.50 and 82.50 coming into focus. Immediate resistance rests at 86.21 with a break above carrying oil toward 87.90 and potentially the 90.00 psychological level.

I agreeI declineChange my preferences US Europe Arab Asia Africa | Politics Economy Oil&Energy Entertainment Sport Oil prices surge amid political uncertainty, geopolitical tensions Date 7/16/2024 4:45:28 AM Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter (MENAFN) Oil prices saw a modest increase on Monday as geopolitical uncertainty in the United States and the Middle East outweighed pressures from a stronger dollar and subdued demand in China. brent crude futures edged up by 15 cents, or 0.2 percent, to reach USD85.18 per barrel by 0425 GMT, following a slight decline of 37 cents on Friday. Similarly, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose by 20 cents to USD82.41 per barrel, marking a 0.2 percent gain.The attempted assassination of U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump earlier in the week contributed to market uncertainty, according to Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG. This event has cast a shadow over the political landscape of a deeply divided country as it approaches the election period, potentially influencing market sentiment.Geopolitical risks in the Middle East also played a role in supporting oil prices, highlighting ongoing concerns about regional stability. Furthermore, the market remains bolstered by the continuing supply cuts by OPEC+ members. Iraq's oil ministry has pledged to counter any excess oil production starting from 2024, indicating a commitment to manage global supply levels amidst market fluctuations.Despite these factors, oil prices had faced downward pressure last week. Brent crude had declined by more than 1.7 percent after four consecutive weeks of gains, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures dropped by 1.1 percent. This decline was attributed to weak demand for oil in China, the largest importer of crude globally, where crude oil imports fell by 2.3 percent in the first half of the year to 11.05 million barrels per day. Factors contributing to this decline included disappointing fuel demand and reduced output by independent refiners amid narrow profit margins.China's economic slowdown in the second quarter, exacerbated by challenges such as a prolonged property downturn and job market instability, has raised expectations for additional stimulus measures from Beijing to bolster domestic demand. These developments are closely monitored by market participants for potential implications on global oil consumption and economic recovery trends.

This accounts for 17.3% of the total crude oil exports from the ports of these two seas. In total, 19 out of 100 tankers with crude oil from the Baltic and 4 out of 29 tankers from the Black Sea arrived in Turkey. To estimate this in monetary terms, you can do the following simple arithmetic: 2.4 million tons * 7.3 = 17.52 million barrels * $79.58 = $1.4 billion USD (per month).However, that is not all - unlike India, Turkey is the absolute champion in the sea import of Russian petroleum products (in addition to crude oil - diesel fuel, etc.). In May 2024, Turkey imported - according to our own monitoring - 2.3 million tons of petroleum products from Russian ports of the Baltic Sea (0.7 million tons) and the Black Sea (1.6 million tons). This represents 37.7% of the total export of petroleum products from Russian ports in these two seas.The number of tankers with Russian petroleum products received by Turkish ports in May 2024 might shock an unprepared reader: 83 from the Black Sea and 16 from the Baltic. Out of these 99 tankers, 35 were Russian.By the way, after the start of the Great War, Turkey doubled its average monthly import figures in 2022, and then even tripled or quadrupled them. And now not only oil market specialists are asking the rhetorical question: did the use of low-quality Russian diesel fuel triple in Turkey? Or is it something else?Let's add another topic that raises many questions. For a year now, since July 2023, Turkey has been pushing for the resumption of the \"Black Sea Grain Initiative\" (the same one - with the participation of the UN, Russia, and Turkey, from which Russia demonstratively withdrew), although an alternative has been successfully operating all this time - the Ukrainian sea export corridor (without the UN, without Russia, and without Turkey).Why the Turkish president needs this, no one can understand. It remains to be assumed that:a) the Turkish leader knows something about Russia's plans to attack ships heading to the ports of Greater Odesa via the Ukrainian corridor, orb) he is fulfilling the request of Emperor Pu, who certainly does not like that ships on their way to Ukrainian ports are no longer inspected.Yes, we appreciate that Turkey has closed its straits to Russian warships. And we haven't forgotten about the Bayraktars. But...As we noted a few days ago - ALL \"peacemaker\" countries - those that exist and those that will appear - simply have business with Putin's Russia. And they are not concerned about peace. They are concerned about their banks already feeling the strain - otherwise, soon they will have to somehow wind down their business with the aggressor country.

    "Content": "Crude oil falls after weak Chinese growth - London Business News | Londonlovesbusiness.com Tech Property Business London Loves Home Business News Crude oil falls after weak Chinese growth IMAGO/Westlight / Avalon Business NewsEconomic NewsFinance NewsInvestment News Crude oil falls after weak Chinese growth by Antonio Ernesto Di Giacomo Market Analyst Latam at XS.com July 16, 2024 written by Antonio Ernesto Di Giacomo Market Analyst Latam at XS.com 16 th Jul 24 10:26 am Crude oil prices fell slightly on Monday as weak Chinese data raised doubts about the growth of this significant economy. The slowdown in the world's second-largest economy has caused investors' concern, impacting global crude oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell from the market opening, dropping from $81.20 to $80.45 per barrel. Meanwhile, Brent crude also declined, trading at $83.80 per barrel. These drops reflect market concerns over China's economic weakness, a country that plays a crucial role in global oil demand. The world's second-largest economy recorded its weakest year-on-year growth in the second quarter. Forecasts indicated a 5.1% growth, but actual growth was 4.7%. This figure surprised analysts and generated uncertainty about China's ability to maintain its growth pace shortly. Additionally, China's crude oil imports fell by 2.3% in the first half of this year, standing at 11.05 million barrels per day. This decrease in imports is due to disappointing fuel demand, suggesting that economic activity in the country is not as robust as expected. These data indicate that China faces increasing economic headwinds, likely a bad sign for crude oil demand in this vital market. The decline in Chinese demand could have a significant impact on global oil prices, given China's weight in global energy consumption. Losses have been limited as political uncertainty in the United States and the Middle East has supported prices. Despite weak Chinese demand, other geopolitical factors have maintained stability in crude oil prices, preventing more pronounced declines. In conclusion, the weakening of Chinese economic growth has immediately impacted crude oil prices, reflecting concerns about future oil demand. Although geopolitical factors have limited declines, China's economic situation will remain a key factor to monitor in the coming months to understand the evolution of crude oil prices in the global market.

Related Stories Dangote, Lokpobiri, NNPC, NUPRC, NMDPRA leadership meet over refinery, crude crisis July 22, 2024 Dangote, NNPC, NUPRC - Bare bottom struggle by Joseph Edgar July 22, 2024 He mentioned that conversations are ongoing to secure more crude from African countries like Angola, Senegal, and Libya, all of which are oil-producing nations. \"We will start importing crude oil from African countries. When we get to those countries, we'll start negotiating with them. We'll start bringing in from there. \"We have just bought from US and Brazil. So I think by next month, we'll expand the scope to most of African countries. \"If we availability in Nigeria, we won't have to turn to these other countries,\" Dangote said.When asked about the timeline for sourcing crude from these African countries, Dangote stated that it could begin as soon as next month. News continues after this ad \"Very soon. I think by next month. You know crude, you have to book two months in advance. So, I'll say October we'll be bringing in from these African countries,\" Dangote responded. Feedstock from US, Brazil According to recent reports, Dangote refinery secured 6 million barrel crude oil from US, which is expected to reach the $19 billion facility by August.In addition, the mega refinery will also receive about 5 million barrel of crude oil from US by September, data from Bloomberg show.Accordingly, Dangote is also sourcing crude from the South American country, Brazil, in the coming months to ramp up production as it sets to commence the supply of petrol to the market this month.The leadership of Dangote has vehemently lamented the unavailability of crude in Nigeria, forcing the oil facility to seek alternatives from other countries. IOCs unable to supply local refineries Despite being a leading oil producer, Nigeria still struggles to meet its OPEC quota as well as supply local refineries in the country.Some local refineries, including Dangote, have accused International Oil Companies (IOCs) of refusal to meet their demands, alleging that these IOCs prefer to sell the crude abroad.In response, the regulatory body of oil in Nigeria, NUPRC, has insisted that the IOCs meet local demands first, before exporting to other African countries. PMS Supply expected in July Moreover, Dangote has said his refinery will supply petrol to local marketers this month.Dangote mentioned that the change in date was due to a slight delay, prompting the shift from the originally proposed June to mid-July.The CEO said the refinery will commence production of petrol between 10 and 15 of July, while supply to local marketers will commence from the third week of the same month. \"We had a bit of delay, but PMS will start coming out by 10 to 15 of July. But then we want to keep it in tank to make sure that it settles. So by third week of July, we'll be able coming out to take it into the market,\" Dangote said.The refinery is expected to significantly reduce Nigeria's dependence on imported petroleum products.

It is not patriotic on the side of the people in government to allow this to happen. Our local refineries ought to get crude first before exporting the excess to other countries. By this action government and NNPC and all regulators concern have proved to us that making money for themselves is more important than Nigeria economy and her citizen s welfare. There should be immediate ban on crude oil exchange or swap for refined products outside Nigeria. If there should be any, it should be given to Dangote Refinery or any of the local Refineries not foreign Refineries.

International benchmark Brent crude traded at $84.23 per barrel at 09.39 a.m. local time (0639GMT), a decline of 0.73% from the closing price of $84.85 per barrel in the previous trading session.The American benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded at $80.22 per barrel at the same time, a 0.77% fall from the previous session that closed at $80.84 per barrel.The gross domestic product (GDP) of China rose by 4.7% in the second quarter of 2024, below market expectations, according to official figures on Monday.The country's economy expanded by 5.3% in the first quarter, and the market forecast was a GDP growth rate of 5.1% in the second quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said.This comes after data last week showed softness in oil imports, according to Daniel Hynes, a commodity strategist at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.\"Over the first six months of the year, the world's top importer bought less crude oil compared with last year. June crude oil imports fell on both a monthly and annual basis to 46.45 million tons,\" Hynes said in an e-mailed note.Hynes also added that a stronger US dollar emerged as investors ratcheted up their bets that former US President Trump would win back the White House, which dented investor appetite. The US dollar index rose by 0.18% to 104.065 at 09.39 a.m. local time (0639GMT), compared to the previous trading session close. The higher US dollar curbs oil demand and supports price declines.Trump was targeted in an assassination attempt during a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, just days before he was set to accept the Republican nomination for a third term.However, increased expectations that the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) interest rate cut will start soon limited further price declines.The Fed is receiving \"more good\" inflation data, paving the way for its first interest rate cut later this year, Chair Jerome Powell said Monday.Speaking at the Economic Club of Washington, DC, Powell reiterated his comments that the US central bank is looking for \"greater confidence\" that inflation is returning to its 2% target.Powell noted the Fed does not need to wait until inflation hits its 2% long-term target to begin lowering interest rates because of the lagging effect of monetary tightening on inflation data.Market players interpreted Powell's remarks as a return to interest rate cuts may not be far off.Lower interest rates are set to reduce the cost of consumer borrowing and stoke expectations of increased economic growth and demand for oil.

Oil Markets Dangote Refinery to Import First Shipment of Brazilian Crude Oil By: Godwin Okafor, The Naija247news Date: July 14, 2024 Nigeria's Dangote refinery is set to receive its first shipment of Brazilian crude oil as it moves towards full operational capacity. This marks a historic purchase for Nigeria, with the refinery importing a one-million-barrel cargo of Brazil's Tupi crude, scheduled for delivery in the latter half of next month.Thank you for reading this post, don't forget to subscribe! The Dangote refinery has been crucial in reducing Nigeria's reliance on imported fuel. Despite being Africa's largest oil producer, Nigeria has historically depended on foreign fuel imports to meet domestic needs due to insufficient refining capacity. By importing crude and refining it locally, Nigeria aims to enhance energy security, reduce import dependency, and lower fuel prices for consumers. Sourcing crude oil from diverse global suppliers will be key to the Dangote refinery's success and Nigeria's broader energy strategy. The Brazilian crude, sold by Petrobras, is one of the most cost-effective and suitable oil grades on the global market. Earlier this week, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) reached an agreement with oil producers to supply crude oil to domestic refineries at market prices, ending a supply dispute that had strained relations with international oil companies. This agreement is part of Nigeria's broader efforts to ensure a stable supply of crude for its refineries, strengthening the country's energy infrastructure and reducing over-reliance on any single source. As Nigeria continues to build its refining capabilities, the Dangote refinery stands at the forefront of this transformative journey.

    "Content": "Oil futures: Crude prices extend losses on economic, demand concerns Oil futures: Crude prices extend losses on economic, demand concerns Crude Oil Refined Products 16 Jul 2024 Quantum Commodity Intelligence - Crude oil futures Tuesday were sliding lower as concerns over broader economic growth offset increasing prospects for a September US rate cut. Front-month Sep24 ICE Brent futures were trading at $83.75/b (1900 GMT), compared to Monday's settle of $84.85/b and an intraday low of $83.30/b. At the same time Aug24 NYMEX WTI was trading at $80.77/b , versus Monday's settle of $81.91/b. Markets remained subdued in the early part of the week despite Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicating that the nation's central bank does not need to see inflation at 2% before cutting rates. \"The implication of that is that if you wait until inflation gets all the way down to 2%, you've probably waited too long, because the tightening that you're doing, or the level of tightness that you have, is still having effects which will probably drive inflation below 2%,\" Powell said in Monday's comments to the Economic Club of Washington, DC. The comments came after last Thursday's lower-than-expected inflation report lifted the prospect of a long-awaited interest rate cut this September, in turn boosting economic growth and oil consumption. China Benchmarks opened the week softer after disappointing GDP figures from China, while crude oil throughput continued to slide last month as thin margins weighed on utilisation rates across the country. The Chinese National Bureau of Statistics data showed Asia's biggest oil refiner processing 58.32 million mt of crude oil in June, equating to 14.19 million bpd. \"The weak economic data in China also weighed on sentiment in the crude oil market. This comes after data last week showed softness in oil imports. Over the first six months of the year,\" said ANZ commodity strategist Daniel Hynes, adding there are also concerns that demand in the US peaked during the 4 July holiday. Elsewhere, investors continue to monitor stop-start ceasefire talks on the Gaza conflict, while Houthi militants have launched three attempted attacks on regional shipping, including an oil tanker, as the Yemen-based group expands its range to the Mediterranean. This included Houthis publishing a video of a uncrewed surface vessel (USV) hitting the crude oil tanker Chios Lion in the Red Sea on 15 July.

(Odessa American/Eli Hartman) COYANOSA The Waha Hub operates in semi-obscurity out here some 60 miles southwest of Odessa in Pecos County, but it is an indispensable part of the Permian Basin's natural gas industry. The Permian Basin Petroleum, Texas Oil & Gas and Texas Pipeline associations say it has also been the scene of consternation as the price of gas has sometimes gone negative in recent years. \"While there is a physical location for the Waha Hub, it is really more a hub for trading natural gas,\" PBPA President Ben Shepperd said. \"The physical network of pipelines crisscrossing the area, which includes intersections at the Waha Hub, connect production to domestic destinations including the West Coast, the Midwest and the Texas Gulf Coast as well as international destinations. \"It is vital that each of the physical assets that make up this network is monitored and protected. While this production originates domestically, it is part of the global marketplace.\" Shepperd said PBPA members are often faced with making difficult business decisions and none are tougher than those tied to the global marketplace including spot prices for production. \"We are proud of the efforts our members make in engaging in such a complex business and the planning it takes to produce this vital commodity that benefits people the world over,\" he said. \"Because of the high levels of production in the Permian Basin and the need for additional takeaway infrastructure, prices for natural gas production traded through the Waha Hub have been depressed. \"And while we all celebrated our nation's independence over the July Fourth holiday, we were not celebrating Waha pricing as we saw prices go to nearly negative $4 for a five-day period. There does not appear to be one identifiable reason for this drop, but it could be attributed to low demand over the weekend and the impacts of Hurricane Beryl, which resulted in gas storage disruption along the Gulf Coast and power outages in certain parts of the state like Houston.\" But U.S. domestic conditions might gradually be improving. The London-based OilPrice.com news website said July 6 that American natural gas storage surplus to the 5-year average of inventories had declined for a seventh consecutive week, falling to 528 billion cubic feet at the end of June on the back of robust gas-fired power demand and production cuts. \"The average value of U.S. natural gas consumption coming from the power sector rose to 45.3 BCf per day by the end of June, a whopping 14-percent higher than the same period a year ago thanks to an exceptionally hot summer,\" OilPrice.com said. \"The launch of the Mountain Valley Pipeline on July 1 has led to a recovery in natural gas output across the Appalachian Basin with production expected to jump to 35 BCf per day from the Marcellus and Utica shale plays. \"For six consecutive weeks already, hedge funds have been holding a net long position in Henry Hub futures, currently around 35,000 contracts, putting an end to extremely bearish market positioning in January-May.\" The Waha Hub has more than a dozen takeaway pipelines including four major interstate pipelines and nine Texas intrastate pipelines, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Some of those include the Trans-Pecos Pipeline, the Agua Blanca Pipeline and the Permian Highway Pipeline. TXOGA Chief Economist Dean Foreman said West Texas needs pipelines to move natural gas, a by-product of oil production, to consumer markets such as the Gulf Coast or exports to Mexico when demand seasonally decreases. \"West Texas has three natural gas storage facilities, OneOK Texas for the Felmac, Keystone and Salado fields, and New Mexico has two more for the Grama Ridge and Washington Ranch fields,\" Foreman said from Austin. \"But the industry still relies on pipeline egress to market the gas and when in-region demand drops, there historically has been excess supply in the spring of recent years.\" Foreman said natural gas spot prices turned negative at the Waha Hub on an average monthly basis in the springs of 2020, 2023 and 2024. \"These are seasonal periods when natural gas consumption eases and storage for the next winter begins,\" he said. \"It's an economic question whether the supply justifies that additional pipeline capacity be built, but this explains why West Texas has distinct characteristics as a natural gas market that differ at times from those at the Henry Hub in Louisiana.\" TPA President Thure Cannon said the Waha is an area where pipelines bring supply from the Permian Basin and other producing areas to access pipelines that take this supply to the demand centers on the West Coast, north to the Mid-Continent and east to the Texas Gulf Coast. \"Waha has evolved over time and it is continuing to grow as production increases along with the need to access markets,\" Cannon said from Austin. \"There are various pipeline headers in the area that help aggregate available supplies and deliver this supply to a market-demand-based pipeline network.\" He said several TPA member companies have assets in the area. \"As production and supply continue to grow, new market access pipelines will need to be developed,\" Cannon said. \"As far as what drives gas prices in the region, it goes back to supply and demand. \"As production grows, there is limited pipeline takeaway and local demand. In general when there is limited local demand or low demand out west, the region will see depressed prices compared with the prices on the Texas Gulf Coast. \"This usually happens in the shoulder months, March to May and October to mid-December.\" %5B%7B%22id%22%3A20%2C%22name%22%3A%22Odessa%20American%20Morning%20Headlines%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22The%20day's%20top%20stories.%22%7D%5D News, straight to your inbox!Sign up for our Odessa American Morning Headlines newsletter. Sorry, something went wrong! subscribe Congratulations! You're all set! Cannon said that has been evident in the last few weeks as high temperatures out west and 100 percent of available pipeline capacity taken helped lift gas prices. \"Periods of low demand and restricted pipeline capacity due to maintenance will usually result in heavily discounted pricing in the region,\" he said. \"It is clear that there is a great demand for a more robust pipeline network in the Waha region as well as throughout Texas so that the midstream industry can continue to deliver the vital hydrocarbons that make all our lives better.\" Like this: Like Loading...

The 40-mile pipeline transports natural gas from Whistler Pipeline's Agua Dulce Header to Cheniere's Corpus Christi Liquefaction facility in Texas. The pipeline is capable of providing approximately 1.7 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of natural gas transportation capacity to the Cheniere Corpus Christi Liquefaction facility from markets on Whistler Pipeline's Agua Dulce Header in South Texas. The receipt points in Agua Dulce provide Cheniere direct access to Permian and Eagle Ford volumes in addition to volumes sourced along the Gulf Coast. The ADCC Pipeline further enhances the natural gas infrastructure in Texas and creates an additional demand point for Permian gas. Further, the infrastructure supports U.S. LNG exports to global markets. The ADCC Pipeline is a joint venture owned 70 percent by Whistler Pipeline LLC, which is a joint venture between WhiteWater, MPLX LP, and Enbridge - and 30 percent by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cheniere Energy. WhiteWater is an Austin, Texas-based infrastructure company and operator of the Whistler Pipeline. The Whistler Pipeline is an approximately 450-mile, 42-inch intrastate pipeline that transports natural gas from the Waha Header in the Permian Basin to Agua Dulce, Texas, providing direct access to South Texas and export markets. An approximately 50-mile 36-inch lateral provides connectivity to the Midland Basin. \u00ab Arizona regulators laud largest utilities for successfully meeting higher electricity demands NREL researchers say offshore wind turbines offer path for clean hydrogen production >> Connect with Us Podcast Have an idea for our new podcast?

It did not provide the volumes. Russia is a part of the GECF, sometimes dubbed the \"gas OPEC\", which accounts for more than two thirds of global natural gas reserves. Advertisement: The National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC) NGC's HSSE strategy is reflective and supportive of the organisational vision to become a leader in the global energy business. ngc.co.tt GECF said pipeline gas imports by the EU from Russia and Azerbaijan have been higher in each month of 2024, compared with the corresponding months in 2023. Russian pipeline gas exports plummeted to Europe to a post-Soviet lows last year after Moscow's relations with the West reached its rock bottom since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis over the conflict in Ukraine. Russia supplied a total of about 63.8 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas to Europe by various pipelines in 2022, according to Reuters calculations. The volume decreased further, by 55.6%, to 28.3 bcm last year. At their peak in 2018-19, annual flows to the region reached between 175 bcm and 180 bcm. According to Reuters calculations, Russian energy giant Gazprom's GAZP.MM average daily natural gas supplies to Europe jumped by almost 23% in June from a year earlier to 81.8 million cubic metres, rebounding from last year's post-Soviet lows, although they fell 8.6% from May. Russian pipeline gas supplies have been closely watched in recent months as Moscow's five-year gas transit deal with Ukraine expires after Dec. 31. While Russia has signalled it was willing to continue with the transit, Ukraine has said it would not renew the agreement with Moscow.

The 42nd Judicial District Court in DeSoto Parish ruled that Energy Transfer could not block Williams from constructing LEG pipeline crossings under the ETC Texas Pipeline in DeSoto and Sabine parishes in northwestern Louisiana. Williams as well as DT Midstream Inc. (DTM) and Momentum Midstream LLC have accused Energy Transfer of upending industry practices for pipeline crossings. The pipeline operators have said it is an attempt by Energy Transfer to prevent competitors from transporting natural gas from the Haynesville Shale.

On July 8, the field's production began flowing to the Mellitah oil port through the 250 km Al-Feel - Mellitah oil pipeline. In May 2024, state-owned Mellitah Oil and Gas and Nafusa Oil Operations signed an agreement for the transport, handling, and shipment of crude oil via the Al-Feel - Mellitah pipeline and completed a new shipping line. Production from the field will gradually increase, reaching 8,000 barrels per day by mid-July and 10,000 barrels per day by next August. Over the past few months, NOC has been revitalizing and rehabilitating several production sites with the goal of achieving a production rate of 2 million barrels per day by 2030.

According to Reuters, the $20 billion refinery is currently producing a lower grade of gasoil than anticipated as it awaits the restart of units necessary for producing cleaner fuels. Consequently, the refinery is seeking buyers in neighbouring markets. Related Stories Dangote, Lokpobiri, NNPC, NUPRC, NMDPRA leadership meet over refinery, crude crisis July 22, 2024 Dangote, NNPC, NUPRC - Bare bottom struggle by Joseph Edgar July 22, 2024 In May, gasoil exports from the refinery reached nearly 100,000 barrels per day (bpd), almost doubling April's levels, data from analytics firm Kpler indicated. Most of these exports were directed to other West African countries, with one shipment sent to Spain. However, preliminary data for June shows a significant drop in gasoil volumes, although overall oil product exports, including fuel oil, naphtha, and jet fuel, remained relatively high at 225,000 bpd. Decline in European exports to West Africa \"The refinery has shifted the balance in West Africa,\" impacting European markets, a European distillates trading source told Reuters. Kpler data revealed that EU and UK gasoil exports to West Africa fell to a four-year low of 29,000 bpd in May, while Russian exports to the region dropped to an eight-month low of 87,000 bpd in the same month. Dangote has been selling some high-sulphur gasoil in the Nigerian market, but a dispute has arisen with local fuel retailers over who is responsible for selling the dirtier fuel. News continues after this ad The Petroleum Industry Bill passed in 2021, mandated a sulphur content of 50 parts per million (ppm) to align with the sub-regional ECOWAS standards adopted in 2020. However, the regulator permitted the sale of gasoil with sulphur content above 200 ppm locally from the beginning of the year until June, allowing local refineries and importers more time to comply with the new standard. As European countries, including major hubs like Belgium and the Netherlands, tighten regulations on high-sulphur gasoil exports, cargoes from the Dangote refinery have found markets in regions with more lenient motor fuel standards. More Insights Earlier in May, the Chairman of the Dangote refinery, Aliko Dangote had stated that when fully completed, the refinery will supply product to West and Central African countries as its capacity is too big for Nigeria alone. This decline in gasoil exports from Europe to West Africa confirms earlier reports by Reuters which stated that the refinery has the potential to reduce the $17 billion in oil imports into the continent and even lead to the closure of some European refineries. In 2023, West Africa became the largest regional recipient of Europe's gasoline exports, receiving roughly one-third of the continent's average exports, which totalled 1.33 million barrels per day (bpd).

    "Content": "US natural gas prices fall - Markets - Business Recorder Markets Print 2024-07-04 US natural gas prices fall Reuters Published July 4, 2024 Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Comments Follow us NEW YORK: US natural gas futures held near a seven-week low on Wednesday as the market waits for direction from what should be a bullish federal report expected to show last week's storage build was smaller than usual for an eighth week in a row. That lack of price movement came despite a bullish heat wave expected to linger over much of the country through at least mid-July and a bearish rise in output so far in July versus June and the tremendous oversupply of gas still in storage. The heat wave should prompt power generators to continue burning lots of gas to produce electricity to keep air conditioners humming. Traders said recent storage builds have been smaller than usual because several producers cut output earlier in the year after futures prices dropped to 3-1/2-year lows in February and March. Higher prices in recent weeks, however, prompted some producers, including EQT and Chesapeake Energy, to return to the well pad. Analysts forecast US utilities added 32 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas into storage during the week ended June 28. That compares with an increase of 76 bcf in the same week last year and a five-year (2019-2023) average rise of 69 bcf for this time of year. If correct, that will leave about 19% more gas in storage than normal at this time of year. Front-month gas futures for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 0.8 cents, or 0.3%, to $2.443 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 8:45 a.m. EDT (1245 GMT). On Tuesday, the contract closed at its lowest since May 15 for a second day in a row. Recent declines in the front-month caused futures for September, which usually trade at a discount to August, to jump to a record premium of around 2.9 cents per mmBtu over the August contract. In the spot market, next-day gas prices at the Waha hub in West Texas plunged from a negative 52 cents per mmBtu for Tuesday to negative $2.06 for Wednesday as pipeline constraints trapped gas in the Permian Shale. It was the fourth time in seven days that Waha prices fell into negative territory during the current heat wave and the 21st time so far this year. Next-day Waha prices first averaged below zero in 2019. It happened 17 times in 2019, six in 2020, none in 2021 or 2022, and once in 2023. Financial firm LSEG said gas output in the Lower 48 US states rose to an average of 101.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in July. US natural gas Comments Comments are closed.

Expand Here's the latest: August Nymex natural gas futures down 12.3 cents to $2.478/MMBtu as of 2:40 p.m. ET Lower 48 gas production rose to 102 Bcf/d on Sunday, the highest level since March 11, Wood Mackenzie data show Category 4 Hurricane Beryl is tracking to cross Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, potentially avoiding a direct strike on the Lower 48 The August contract started to trade below $2.500/MMBtu before 11 a.m. ET before bouncing on either side of the closely watched level into midday. \"Critical support sits at $2.50,\" EBW Analytics Group analyst Eli Rubin said. Forecasting from DTN shed 6.5 cooling degree days (CDD) from its Lower 48 forecasts over the next three weeks since Friday, equating to 10.4 Bcf lower demand, Rubin said. Maxar's Weather Desk also pointed to cooler temperatures. However, NatGasWeather painted a more mixed picture with weekend updates both shedding and adding modest amounts of CDD in the American and European weather models. Both forecasts continued to point to the hottest first half of July of the past 50 years, however, both models have tended to overestimate summer's heat \"and the expectation is they are doing so again this summer,\" NatGasWeather said. Wood Mackenzie estimated Lower 48 gas production fell to 100.0 Bcf/d on Monday, but analysts expected that number to be revised higher in later cycles because of volatility at the start of the month. Freeport LNG terminal's Train 2 was down about 15 hours from Saturday to Sunday, but flows have bounced back on Monday Cheniere Energy Inc.'s Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas export facility may have completed a round of maintenance U.S. LNG feed gas demand climbed to about 12.9 Bcf/d for Monday, highest since last Sunday, according to NGI's U.S. LNG Export Tracker Freeport staff told Texas officials that the facility's Train 2 tripped because of compressor issues. Feed gas flows fell to about 1.6 Bcf/d Saturday and 1.3 Bcf/d Sunday, NGI data show. On Monday, service regained its earlier June pace with nominations at around 1.9 Bcf/d. Kpler has a ship in berth loading and more scheduled through the week. Meanwhile, an uptick in feed gas flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend hints at the terminal wrapping up its traditional June maintenance. Flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend topped out above 4.3 Bcf on Sunday and were scheduled to be around 4.2 Bcf on Monday, NGI data show. \"The terminal could likely run a bit higher, with optimal summer flows near 4.4 Bcf/d,\" Criterion Research Inc.'s James Bevan, vice president of Research, said on online energy platform Enelyst. Elsewhere, flows to Cheniere's Corpus Christi and Sempra Infrastructure's Cameron LNG terminals were stable at about 2.3 Bcf/d and 1.9 Bcf/d, respectively, NGI data show. NGI modeling 29 Bcf injection into Lower 48 storage for week ending June 28 A print in-line with NGI's estimate for this week's U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report would further eat into the Lower 48's lofty storage surplus. Last week's report showed working gas in underground storage stood at 528 Bcf, or a nearly 21% surplus to the five-year average. All but eight of the last 10 weekly injections have lagged the five-year average, narrowing the surplus from 37% in mid-April. For the week ending June 28, the five-year average is an injection of 69 Bcf, while the year-earlier period saw an 76 Bcf increase. Henry Hub spot prices lower at $2.205, down 18.5 cents, NGI's MidDay Price Alert data show Southeast weaker on cooler forecasts, West Texas prices stay negative Waha rose 8.5 cents to negative $2.035 on Monday, according to NGI's MidDay Price Alert. Transco Zone 5 in the Southeast shed 25.5 cents to average $2.560, as forecasts for the region turned cooler. Weather model runs on Monday pulled Southeast forecasts for the next 10 days below normal while the 11- to 15-day outlook is only now marginally above normal, Bevan said. The cooler look resulted in a demand loss of around 9 Bcf for the region, stacking onto losses from Thursday and Friday, Bevan said. Also likely impacting prices in the Southeast is supply from the Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC (MVP), which officially began firm transport service on Monday. The new pipeline is scheduled to deliver its highest volume yet to the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Co. (aka Transco) on Monday at around 0.97 Bcf/d, or nearly half its capacity, according to Wood Mackenzie flow data. Transco's Station 160 in North Carolina, which is south of the mainline's interconnect with MVP, showed southbound flows into the Southeast rose above 2 Bcf/d Monday, setting a new high for 2024, Bevan said.

Skip to main content Advertisement Home Special reports 02 Jul 24 Rystad Energy: Bullish market fundamentals are the main contributing factor to higher global oil prices Advertisement Here is Rystad Energy's oil macro update from Global Market Analysis Director Claudio Galimberti: \"Strong market fundamentals are pushing oil prices higher this week, on track for four consecutive weeks of increases. Lower crude exports from OPEC and Russia, just as refinery runs ramp up for the summer peak, are helping contribute to a tighter-than-expected market, and prices are reacting accordingly. Increasingly likely interest rates cuts by the Fed in coming months and still high geopolitical risk premium are adding to the upward pressure.\" Better-than-expected market fundamentals and expectations of forthcoming interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve are helping keep oil prices on a bullish trajectory this week.Rystad Energy modelling suggests most of the price increases have been driven by bullish fundamentals, specifically on the refining and crude side, while macroeconomic factors and ongoing concerns regarding the escalation of conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine have played a secondary, albeit non-negligible, role.Brent prices increased by more than 6% in June, and July is starting on a similar path.Looking at the fundamentals, we have significantly lowered our forecast for US oil production from August onwards.These adjustments reflect a downturn in Permian oil output due to ongoing low activity and consolidation through mergers and acquisitions.Most changes are concentrated on the Texas side, while New Mexico has shown resilience, although April data reflects a decline in monthly figures, averaging a fall of approximately 80 000 bpd. Overall, the downward adjustment from August 2024 through December 2025 averages about 200 000 bpd.These adjustments are bullish for Brent prices and support a narrowing of the WTI-Brent spread.It should help provide some relief for OPEC+, given the production cuts they have implemented and the planned unwinding of the voluntary reductions starting in October, for the following 12 months.Recent reports suggest OPEC+ crude exports declined in June versus May, but the latest official data showed steady exports from the Middle East and declining exports from Russia in May.If crude exports from OPEC - after accounting for changes in crude burns and refinery runs - are confirmed to have declined by somewhere between 3% and 4% in June, then that may point to greater compliance by OPEC members. However, that is still speculative.Russia's seaborne crude flows in the week to 23 June appear to have dropped by 0.66 million bpd, to the lowest in more than three months.The combined effect of lower crude exports from OPEC and Russia, right at the time when global refinery runs are expected to further rump up - from 83.1 million bpd in June to 84.4 in August - would explain the tighter crude market and the surge in Brent prices over the past three weeks.On macroeconomics, the latest data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) showed that US inflation, measured by the personal consumption expenditures (CPE) index, eased further to 2.6% year on year in May, matching expectations. The core PCE, excluding food and fuel prices, also decreased to 2.6%, the lowest since March 2021.These figures are pivotal for the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate-setting decision on 31 July, with markets anticipating at least two quarter-point rate cuts this year, potentially starting in September. Despite the encouraging inflation data, a September cut remains uncertain as the pace of decline remains slow, which may be perceived as too gradual. On the political front, the US Presidential debate on Thursday night has dominated the airwaves.Early policy indications suggest either candidate would favour protectionist measures and large budget deficits if elected.This isn't good news for inflation, as both stances are inflationary.Energy-specific messaging was hard to identify in the debate, but it's safe to assume that a Trump administration would be pro-deregulation while Biden would continue to push policies aimed at advancing the green transition. In Europe, French President Emmanuel Macron's decision to call snap elections for the National Assembly backfired on Sunday as the National Rally party won by a significant margin in the first round of voting. Macron took a huge risk, but with the second round of voting this coming weekend, the exact fallout is still unclear.The second round of voting on 7 July will be pivotal for France's political stability and its leadership within the EU and the transatlantic community during this critical period.

Front-month gas futures for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 2.4 cents, or 1.0%, to $2.454 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 8:49 a.m. EDT (1249 GMT), putting the contract on track for its lowest close since May 15 for a second day in a row.In other news, a federal judge dealt US President Joe Biden's climate agenda a setback by blocking the Democrat's administration from continuing to pause the approval of applications to export liquefied natural gas (LNG). In Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), power grid operator for most of the state, said peak demand this week will come close to but not break the record for the month of July as homes and businesses crank up their air conditioners to escape a heat wave.In the spot market, next-day gas prices at the Waha hub in West Texas plunged by about 123% to a negative 52 cents per mmBtu for Tuesday as pipeline constraints trap gas in the Permian Shale again.That is the third time in six days Waha prices fell into negative territory during the current heat wave and the 20th time so far this year. Next-day Waha prices first averaged below zero in 2019. It happened 17 times in 2019, six in 2020, none in 2021 and 2022, and once in 2023.In the Caribbean Sea, Hurricane Beryl, an extremely dangerous major hurricane, will hit Jamaica on Wednesday before slamming slam into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the latest US National Hurricane Center (NHC) outlook.

    "Content": "Dangote Refinery: Crude oil supply options - Blueprint Newspapers Limited Skip to content The international corporations drilling oil in Nigeria are the country's greatest enemies. They have never hidden their condescension for Nigeria even as they are allowed to operate the industry on their own terms. In fact, the IOCs are partially responsible for Nigeria's total dependence on imported refined petroleum products.The international oil companies (IOCs) are compelled to operate refineries in most of the countries they drill oil. In Nigeria they defiantly snubbed the federal government's directives that they should establish refineries. Their excuse was that no refinery could succeed in Nigeria because the federal government stands around to fix unacceptable pump prices for refined petroleum products.Aliko Dangote, president of the Dangote Group, and some development banks in the international money market came together to prove that the treacherous oil firms exploiting crude oil in Nigeria were telling transparent lies when they refused to establish refineries in Nigeria on the grounds that the pump prices of refined petroleum products were controlled by the federal government. The international money market advanced loans close to $9 billion to Dangote for the establishment of what is now acknowledged as one of the world's largest refineries.No one would advance such a colossal sum as a loan for a venture known to have no means of repaying the loan. The fact that the international development banks were willing to fund Dangote Refinery is a clear indication that the venture was viable and could not be bugged down by government regulation of the pump prices of refined petroleum products.The lies of the IOCs were exposed by the success in sourcing for funds to build a giant refinery in Nigeria.The mischievous oil firms were disgraced as their lies were exposed. They gnashed their teeth and proceeded to wait for Dangote and the Nigerian people down the road.The refinery they were determined to truncate came on stream in January 2024 and in apparent frustration they drew up fresh plans to sabotage the business of the refinery and keep Nigeria as a perpetual importer of refined petroleum products.They know that if Dangote Refinery succeeds, the refineries in Europe that were supplying refined petroleum products to Nigeria at a catastrophic cost of well over $20 billion annually could be out of businessThey decided to use the last weapon in their armoury to frustrate Dangote Refinery. They defiantly refused to sell crude oil to Dangote. Those who reluctantly offer to sell the feedstock put their price tag at $6 above what obtains in the international market.Consequently, Dangote has been compelled to import crude oil for his refinery from the United States of America (USA) when Nigeria remains the highest producer of crude oil in Africa.The treacherous international oil companies operating in Nigeria have finally held Dangote Refinery and the Nigerian people in the jugular.Diesel from Dangote Refinery is more expensive than the high sulfur diesels imported by independent petroleum marketers from Europe into Nigeria.The most painful aspect of the sabotage by the IOCs is that the regulator of the industry sees nothing wrong with collaborating with foreigners to frustrate a Nigerian venture designed to ease the merciless grip of European petroleum refiners on Nigerians.The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) apathetically issues licences to independent petroleum marketers to import diesel from Europe with a weak naira and torment Nigerian consumers with high energy cost that escalates the country's catastrophic inflationary trend.When newsmen confronted the agency on the illogicality of encouraging diesel imports when a Nigerian refinery is ready to supply, NMDPRA retorted that in a deregulated market, marketers are free to source diesel from anywhere.NMDPRA is the regulatory arm of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL). The company is more or less an appendage of the mischievous international oil companies battling to protect the interest of European crude oil refiners patronised by NNPCL.NNPCL, as industry regulator, could order the deceitful IOCs to sell crude oil to Dangote Refinery at international market price. But it could only do so to the detriment of its own selfish interest.NNPCL would lose trillions of naira if Dangote Refinery gets crude oil from Nigeria and sells refined petroleum products locally at reduced pump prices.That would mean the end of the petrol subsidy scandal through which the company rakes in trillions of naira annually. That explains why NNPCL allows foreign exploiters to frustrate Dangote Refinery.NNPCL has unrestrained powers to supply crude oil to Dangote Refinery which at the moment is the only way to ease the asphyxiating hold of high energy cost on Nigeria's economy.If the treacherous IOCs defy NNPCL's directive to supply crude oil to Dangote Refinery at international market rate, the company could do the job by itself.NNPCL allocates 445,000 barrels of crude oil daily to Nigeria's moribund refineries. Nigeria's four refineries have not refined a barrel of crude oil in the last three years.Consequently, NNPCL exports the 445,000 barrels of crude oil daily to foreign refineries that feed Nigeria with refined petroleum products in return. If NNPCL reroutes the crude oil to Dangote Refinery, Nigeria would benefit extensively.The foreign refineries use the residue of the crude oil supplied by NNPCL for their petrochemical products and export them to Nigeria. If Dangote Refinery gets the crude oil, the residue would be used to produce resins that would be used to ease the escalating cost of producing plastic containers in the soft drink and brewery industries.Besides, NNPCL owes Dangote Refinery the sum of $1.7 billion as part of the 20 per cent equity it bought. It was expected to pay back with 300,000 barrels of crude oil daily. Its refusal to supply borders on betrayal of trust.It is rather saddening that Mele Kyari, the man who navigated NNPCL through the horrendous petrol subsidy scandal and crude oil theft, is still its group managing director. The man should do the right thing.

    "Content": "US natgas prices ease to 6-week low on rising output, lower LNG feedgas US natgas prices ease to 6-week low on rising output, lower LNG feedgas July 2 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures eased about 1% to a six-week low on rising output, forecasts for less demand over the next two weeks than previously expected due to lower liquefied natural gas (LNG) feedgas and an ongoing oversupply of gas in storage. Front-month gas futures for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 2.4 cents, or 1.0%, to $2.454 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 8:49 a.m. EDT (1249 GMT), putting the contract on track for its lowest close since May 15 for a second day in a row. Advertisement: The National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC) NGC's HSSE strategy is reflective and supportive of the organisational vision to become a leader in the global energy business. ngc.co.tt In other news, a federal judge dealt U.S. President Joe Biden's climate agenda a setback by blocking the Democrat's administration from continuing to pause the approval of applications to export liquefied natural gas (LNG). In Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), power grid operator for most of the state, said peak demand this week will come close to but not break the record for the month of July as homes and businesses crank up their air conditioners to escape a heat wave. In the spot market, next-day gas prices at the Waha hub in West Texas plunged by about 123% to a negative 52 cents per mmBtu for Tuesday as pipeline constraints trap gas in the Permian Shale again. That is the third time in six days Waha prices fell into negative territory during the current heat wave and the 20th time so far this year. Next-day Waha prices first averaged below zero in 2019. It happened 17 times in 2019, six in 2020, none in 2021 and 2022, and once in 2023. In the Caribbean Sea, Hurricane Beryl, an extremely dangerous major hurricane, will hit Jamaica on Wednesday before slamming slam into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the latest U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) outlook. After marching across the Yucatan, the NHC projected Beryl will weaken into a tropical storm by the time it enters the Bay of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico, where Mexico produces much of its oil, on Saturday before approaching the Texas-Mexico border on Sunday. SUPPLY AND DEMAND Financial firm LSEG said gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states rose to an average of 101.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in July. That was up from an average of 100.1 bcfd in June and a 17-month low of 99.5 bcfd in May as many producers reduced drilling activities after prices fell to 3-1/2-year lows in February and March. U.S. output hit a monthly record high of 105.5 bcfd in December 2023. Meteorologists projected weather across the Lower 48 states would remain hotter than normal through at least July 17. With hotter weather expected next week, LSEG forecast average gas demand in the Lower 48, including exports, will rise from 98.5 bcfd this week to 104.5 bcfd next week. Those forecasts were lower than LSEG's outlook on Monday. Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants fell to 12.2 bcfd so far in July, down from 12.8 bcfd in June and a monthly record high of 14.7 bcfd in December 2023. That decline was due mostly to an expected drop in feedgas at Cheniere Energy's 4.5-bcfd Sabine Pass in Louisiana to a one-week low of 3.7 bcfd on Tuesday, down from 4.1 bcfd on Monday and an average of 4.0 bcfd over the prior seven days.

State oil company Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos (Pemex) produced 3.65 Bcf/d, or 95% of total gas output last month, with private sector operators accounting for the remainder, according to upstream regulator Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Hidrocarburos (CNH). The top five gas producing fields, all operated by Pemex, were Quesqui (570 MMcf/d), Ixachi (507 MMcf/d), Akal (355 MMcf/d), Maloob (138 MMcf/d) and Onel (133 MMcf/d). Associated gas tied to oil production averaged 1.99 Bcf/d, versus 1.86 Bcf/d for non-associated gas. The International Energy Agency is forecasting a major decline in oil supply from Mexico between 2024 and 2030 due to underinvestment in exploration and production (E&P). President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum has signaled her intent to continue the energy policies of her predecessor Andres Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who has sought to solidify Pemex's dominant role in E&P. Sheinbaum on Thursday (June 27) named economist Luz Elena Gonz\u00e1lez Escobar to be the country's next energy secretary. Gonz\u00e1lez Escobar said she would pursue \"an energy policy that will continue to guarantee national sovereignty and will at the same time advance the energy transition.\" L\u00f3pez Obrador and Sheinbaum also both officially oppose hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in Mexico, despite the country's substantial prospective resources of unconventional natural gas. In a June 20 speech, CNH Chairman Agust\u00edn D\u00edaz Lastra - a L\u00f3pez Obrador appointee - said that exploration work should continue so that unconventional prospective resources could be reclassified as reserves. This would allow unconventional projects to be developed more quickly if fracking is authorized, D\u00edaz indicated. Upon taking office in 2018, L\u00f3pez Obrador canceled bid rounds that would have made onshore unconventional gas blocks available for exploration. Meanwhile, gas imports from the United States have accounted for 6.37 Bcf/d, or 72% of Mexico's total gas supply this year through June 19, up 536 MMcf/d from the same period last year, Wood Mackenzie data show. The country's overall gas demand over the same span was down 120 MMcf/d to 8.52 Bcf/d, with only the power sector showing a year/year increase in consumption. Domestic production has accounted for 2.38 Bcf/d, or 27% of Mexican gas supply this year, according to the consultancy. Pemex has consumed 1.56 Bcf/d for its own operations, including enhanced oil recovery and refining. Pemex, for its part, reported a third straight sequential decline in dry gas production from its processing centers to 1.8 Bcf/d in May. Mexico natural gas prices closely track those of the United States due to Mexico's reliance on U.S. imports. Mexico's IPGN monthly natural gas price index averaged $1.922/MMBtu in May 2024, down from $3.159 in May 2023. After slumping below $2.00for much of 2024 so far, Lower 48 natural gas prices have strengthened some with summer underway. NGI's daily Henry Hub spot price averaged $2.390 on Friday.

The spokesperson also said that it was agreed that 21 liquefied natural gas cargos are to arrive in Egypt during the summer, in addition to shipments of mazut fuel. Advertisement: The National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC) NGC's HSSE strategy is reflective and supportive of the organisational vision to become a leader in the global energy business. ngc.co.tt The first gas shipment arrived on Monday, and it is currently being discharged for supply into the national gas grid, the ministry spokesperson said. \"With the third week of July...the national gas grid's supply will be sufficient,\" he added. In June, Egypt fully awarded 20 cargoes of LNG in its biggest purchase of the seaborne fuel, aimed to cover heavy summer demand from July through September. Supplies of the natural gas that helps Egypt generate electricity have been dwindling at a time when an expanding population and urban development have been pushing up electricity demand. When temperatures rise, air conditioning use drives up power consumption. Egypt needs to import around $1.18 billion worth of natural gas and mazut fuel oil to end persistent power cuts exacerbated by consecutive heatwaves, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said last month.

We have declared war on the challenges affecting our crude oil production. War means war. We have the right tools. We know what to fight. We know what we have to do at the level of assets. We have engaged our partners.

Isa made the call at the Nigerian Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week 2024 in Abuja with the theme, \"Showcasing opportunities, driving investment and meeting energy demand.\" Advertisement He told the participants at the event that the approval of IOCs divestment will also restore global investor confidence in Nigeria at a time of huge competition for investments in the energy sector. The IPPG Chairman stated further that despite huge hydrocarbon resource base, with over 37 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves and 207 tcf and 600 tcf of proven gas reserves, the country is currently in a situation where the daily production has significantly dropped to about 1.3 million barrels of crude oil per day and 8.5 billion standard cubic feet of gas per day respectively. This, he noted, is far below the nation's capacity, noting that Nigeria now runs the risk of partial implementation of its national budget considering an estimated deficit of 400,000 bpd from the forecasted 1.78 million bpd. He said, \"IPPG strongly advocates that our member companies - Seplat, the Renaissance Consortium and Oando - have the proven track record to successfully take over and manage these onshore and shallow water assets to realise incremental production in the region of 100,000 - 200,000 barrels of oil and over 1.5 billion SCF of gas per day within 24 months and well over 500,000 barrels of oil per day in the long term. Advertisement \"IPPG believes the timely approval of these IOC divestment transactions will also be a clear signal capable of restoring global investor confidence in Nigeria in an era of competing global investment destinations in Africa and very limited access to capital. \"The urgent need to address deepwater development and production by untangling issues around deepwater development, particularly in terms of competitive fiscal regime being negotiated with Shell, Total Energies, ExxonMobil and Chevron, has the potential to unlock incremental production of 700,000 barrels per day from this terrain in the short to medium term.

Jun 6, 2024 \"Enabling deepwater development will attract significant economic benefits as Nigeria has one of the world's largest untapped deepwater resource bases.\" Isa also the hairman and Co-Founder of Waltersmith Group of Companies called for the adoption of a national value-retention strategy, stating that Nigeria's domestic crude oil refining and petrochemical capacity must be sustained primarily from its domestic crude oil and gas production. He noted that this would transform the country into a net exporter of refined petroleum and petrochemical products that will lay a strong foundation for the rapid industrialization of the Nigerian economy. Advertisement \"It is therefore imperative to grow our daily production to 2.5 million barrels of oil and 10 bcf of gas in the near to long term to ensure we can meet our domestic refinery and petrochemical demands and export commitments to generate the much-needed foreign exchange earnings for macro-economic stability. \"The development of Nigeria's gas resources to catalyse economic growth and complement decarbonisation drive as Nigeria's vast gas resources must be exploited with immediate focus placed on restoring production to existing installed LNG capacity and expanding production (FLNG). \"In addition, we must expand domestic gas utilization (Gas-to-Power; Gas-Based Industries) by investing heavily to address the gas infrastructure deficit facing us today. The International Oil Companies will lead the charge on export gas while IPPG members will drive the domestic gas agenda led by NNPCL,\" he added. Isa noted that the priorities would provide the most realistic and sustainable pathway towards meeting the national long-term production aspiration of four million barrels of oil per day and 13 billion cubic feet of gas per day.

For inquiries: Phone: +234 81 8616 6160 Email: editor.championnews@gmail.com Likes Followers Followers NNPCL declares state of emergency on crude oil production .Calls for collaboration to reduce cost .FG determined to improve oil production, says Lokpobiri .IPPG laments delays in concluding IOCs' divestment transactions .We see energy demand rising by 23% by 2045 - OPEC EnergyLatest News 42 Share UGO AMADI In a move towards increasing Nigeria's crude oil production and growing its reserves, NNPC Ltd has declared a state of emergency on production in Nigeria's oil and gas industry. Group Chief Executive Officer of NNPC Ltd, Mr. Mele Kyari, disclosed this in a keynote address at the opening ceremony of the 23rd edition of the Nigeria Oil & Gas Conference and Exhibition (NOG Energy Week) in Abuja, on Tuesday. \"We have decided to stop the debate. We have declared war on the challenges affecting our crude oil production. War means war. We have the right tools. We know what to fight. We know what we have to do at the level of assets. We have engaged our partners. And we will work together to improve the situation,\" the GCEO declared. According to him, a detailed analysis of assets revealed that Nigeria can conveniently produce two million barrels of crude oil per day without deploying new rigs, but the major impediment to achieving that remains the inability of players to act in a timely manner. He said the \"war\" will help NNPC Ltd. and its partners to speedily clear all identified obstacles to effective and efficient production such as delays in procurement processes, which have become a challenge in the industry. On medium to long-term measures aimed at boosting and sustaining production, Kyari said NNPC Ltd. would replace all the old crude oil pipelines built over four decades ago and also introduce a rig sharing programme with its partners to ensure that production rigs stay in the country for between four and five years which is the standard practice in most climes. He called on all players in the industry to collaborate towards reducing the cost of production and boosting production to target levels. He expressed the Company's commitment to investing in critical midstream gas infrastructure such as the Obiafu-Obrikom-Oben (OB3) and the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano gas pipelines to boost domestic gas production and supply for power generation, industrial development and economic prosperity of the country. On Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Kyari observed that NNPC Ltd. has since keyed into the Presidential CNG drive, adding that in conjunction with partners such as NIPCO Gas, NNPC Ltd. has built a number of CNG stations, 12 of which will be commissioned on Thursday in Lagos and Abuja. NNPC Ltd. is the Principal Sponsor of 2024 NOG Energy Week Conference & Exhibition which has as its theme \"showcasing opportunities, driving investment and meeting energy demand.\" However, with Nigeria's oil production lagging significantly behind OPEC oil production quota, the Minister for State Petroleum Resources (Oil), Senator Heineken Lokpobiri has expressed the Federal Government's determination to improve production in the coming months. The Minister stated this when he gave his ministerial address at the ongoing 2024 NOG week Lokpobiri emphasized Nigeria's commitment to increasing oil production, adding that while Nigeria \"is not in a rush to transition away from oil, the country is actively seeking to enhance its production capabilities\". According to him, \"We are focused on ramping up our oil production . When we came to office the president was concerned in increasing production in every way. I can confidently tell you that most of the deals like Seplat -ExxonMobil deal and other issues like Malabu deal are being resolved. He highlighted the benefits of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which provides a robust legal framework that guarantees returns on investments and has significantly reshaped the oil and gas sector. \"The PIA ensures a secure and profitable investment climate, making Nigeria an attractive location for investors,\" he noted. .IPPG laments delays in concluding IOCs' divestment transactions The Independent Petroleum Producers Group (IPPG) has expressed concerns over the continuos delays in concluding ongoing divestment transactions by the international oil companies (IOCs). Chairman of IPPG, Mr. Abdulrazaq Isa, raised his members' concerns yesterday in Abuja at the ongoing Nigeria Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week 2024, with the theme: \"Showcasing Opportunities, Driving Investment and Meeting Energy Demand\". In his industry address at the event, Isa specifically said that the long-overdrawn delays in concluding the IOCs divestment deals were costly to the Nigerian petroleum industry and extremely detrimental to the country as a whole. He appreciated President Bola Tinubu for the transformative reforms being undertaken by his administratio, pointing out specifically that the recent presidential executive orders and directives were a welcome development for the industry. \"Also of note is His Excellency's direct intervention in untangling issues in some of the long-overdrawn IOC divestment transactions - these delays have been costly to the industry and extremely detrimental to the nation as a whole. \"We are encouraged to see swift progress on implementation and some tangible results within a relatively short period of time. \"Such progressive and impactful policies are exactly what the industry has consistently clamoured for to sustainably develop and move the industry forward\", Isa stated. Notwithstanding those laudable policies and the gradual positive turnarounds being experienced, he maintained that the industry was in dire need of extraordinary focus to mitigate the genuine concerns on its long-term sustainability. According to him, despite Nigeria's world class hydrocarbon resource base of over 37 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves and 207 trillion cubic feet (tcf) and 600 tcf of proven and contingent gas reserves respectively, we find ourselves in a situation where our daily production has significantly dropped and lies at about 1.3 million barrels of oil and 8.5 bcf of gas today. He noted that the current oil and gas production was way below Nigeria's capacity as a nation. He added that by all globally acceptable standards, this reserves to production ratio was extremely low and a clear indicator that the industry was in a dire situation. In addition, Isa noted that \"we now run the risk of partial implementation of our national budget considering an estimated deficit of 400,000 bpd from the forecasted 1.78 million bpd. This trend in production, according to the IPPG chair, \"portends another frightening dimension when we consider that in the not-too-distant future, our overall installed domestic refining capacity, currently closing in on about 1.2 million barrels per day, may soon outstrip our current crude oil production level with the risk of Nigeria finding itself in a position where it is unable to meet its domestic refinery crude demand or even become a net importer of crude oil, God forbid! \"It is against this scary backdrop that IPPG is calling for urgent measures to be undertaken by all relevant stakeholders to immediately arrest this dwindling production level and under-investment by focusing on the following priority areas.\" On the first priority area, he called for immediate conclusion of all pending IOC divestment transactions. Isa posited that IPPG strongly advocates that their member companies such as Seplat, the Renaissance Consortium and Oando have the proven track record to successfully take over and manage those onshore and shallow water assets to realise incremental production in the region of 100,000 - 200,000 barrels of oil and over 1.5bcf of gas per day within 24 months, and well over 500,000bpd in the long term. He maintained that IPPG believes the timely approval of these IOC divestment transactions would also be a clear signal capable of restoring global investor confidence in Nigeria in an era of competing global investment destinations in Africa and very limited access to capital. On the second priority area, Isa stressed the urgent need to address deepwater development and production in Nigeria. He said untangling issues around deepwater development, particularly in terms of competitive fiscal regime being negotiated with Shell, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil and Chevron has the potential to unlock incremental production of 700,000 bpd from this terrain in the short to medium term. Isa stated, \"Enabling deepwater development will attract significant economic benefits as Nigeria has one of the world's largest untapped deepwater resource base. \"Priority Area 3: The adoption of a national value-retention strategy: Nigeria's domestic crude oil refining and petrochemical capacity must be sustained primarily from our domestic crude oil and gas production in order to transform our country into a net exporter of refined petroleum and petrochemical products that will lay a strong foundation for the rapid industrialization of the Nigerian economy. \"It is therefore imperative to grow our daily production to 2.5 million barrels of oil and 10 bcf of gas in the near to long term to ensure we are able to meet our domestic refinery and petrochemical demands and export commitments to generate the much-needed foreign exchange earnings for macro-economic stability.\" On the fourth priority area, the IPPG boss called for the development of Nigeria's gas resources to catalyse economic growth and complement decarbonisation drive. He stressed that Nigeria's vast gas resources must be exploited with immediate focus placed on restoring production to existing installed Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) capacity and expanding production (FLNG). .We see energy demand rising by 23% by 2045 - OPEC Meanwhile, The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) says energy demand will rise by an estimated 23 per cent by 2025. OPEC says the rise will be fueled by a world economy that is expected to double in size, growing from $138 trillion dollars in 2023 to $270 trillion dollars in 2045. The OPEC Secretary-General, Haitham Al Ghais, made this known on Tuesday at the ongoing 23rd Nigerian Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week Conference and Exhibition, holding in Abuja. The conference, which holds from June 30 to July 4, has its theme as \"Showcasing Opportunities, Driving Investment, Meeting Energy Demand\". Addressing the Strategic Conference via teleconference, Al Ghais explained that it forecasted a rapidly expanding world population that would surpass 9.5 billion people. \"Why are we optimistic? Let us consider these statistics, which are based on OPEC's World Oil Outlook. \"Urbanisation alone will account for over half a billion people moving to cities around the world by 2030. \"This data tells us that the world will require all forms of energy to meet long-term energy needs. \"Oil and gas will remain the predominant fuels in the energy mix. \"In fact, oil alone will retain its share at almost 30 per cent in 2045 as world demand for oil soars to an estimated 116 million barrels per day (mb/d) by that time,\" he said. To meet this rapid and robust growth in energy consumption, he said the industry would need to boost investment levels significantly in the years to come. He said according to its research, cumulative oil-related investment requirements from 2024 until 2045 would amount to $14 trillion dollars or around $610 billion dollars on average per year. \"Securing this vital funding is essential to maintaining security of supply and avoiding unwanted volatility. \"In spite of these facts, I am certain you are aware of some recent predictions for peak demand by 2030 and calls for a discontinuation of investment in hydrocarbons,\" he said. Al Ghais further emphasised that indeed, the rush to adopt \"Net-Zero\" strategies was misguided and simply not realistic. The OPEC Secretary General said that developing countries would continue to balance priorities between developing their national economies and addressing climate change. In this regard, he pledged that OPEC and its member countries would continue to advocate for a fair process for adaptation, mitigation and means of implementation, with regard to climate finance and technology. He decried the fact that there were an estimated 675 million people with no access to basic forms of energy and 2.3 billion without access to clean cooking fuels. He tasked World leaders to unite and advocate for the necessary support and resources to make a difference in addressing this important matter. \"Looking ahead, OPEC will continue to enhance dialogue and cooperation with all of its energy partners, including in Africa,\" Al Ghais said. The Secretary-General, while commending President Bola Tinubu, appreciated Nigeria's staunch commitment to OPEC and to the Declaration of Cooperation.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries produced an average of 26.98 million barrels per day in June, marking a decrease of 80,000 barrels per day from the previous month. This slight reduction was attributed to minor cuts in production from Iraq and Nigeria. The survey indicated that Iraq and the UAE did not fully comply with the cuts agreed upon at the beginning of the year with other OPEC members. Additionally, Baghdad was unable to implement the extra production cut it had pledged to compensate for previous overproduction levels. To push crude oil prices higher, the OPEC alliance may need to enforce the committed cuts fully. However, efforts to enhance compliance have shown limited results. In June, Iraq reduced its output by 30,000 barrels per day to 4.25 million barrels per day. This reduction in exports brought the country closer to its assigned quota, but its production still exceeded the quota by approximately 250,000 barrels per day, even without considering additional \"compensatory cuts.\" Related News Bloomberg: Iraq reduced its oil production by 130,000 bpd Iraq boosts oil output by 40,000 bpd in May following OPEC decision Basrah crudes surge following global oil rise Basrah crudes surge despite global oil decline Kirkuk oil production surges to over 360,000 bpd EIA reports surge in Iraqi oil exports to the US Shafaq Live Shafaq Live English English Radio facebook Shafaq news english",

Expand Ahead of the 12 p.m. ET print, the August futures contract was up 2.0 cents at $2.455/MMBtu. The prompt month ticked lower to $2.452 when the EIA data was released, a day early because of the Fourth of July holiday. About 20 minutes later, the contract stood at $2.456, up 2.1 cents from Tuesday's settlement. Prior to the report, NGI modeled a 29 Bcf build. Early estimates to Reuters ranged from builds of 13 Bcf to 76 Bcf, with an average increase of 41 Bcf. The five-year average build was 69 Bcf for the week, while a year ago it was 76 Bcf.

Expand NGI's July Bidweek National Avg. climbed 40.0 cents month/month to $2.215/MMBtu. That was down from $2.560 a year earlier. Trading for the latest bidweek period spanned June 24-26. Weather conditions proved mostly hot across the southern two-thirds of the Lower 48 in that span. National Weather Service (NWS) forecasts call for more of the same through the first half of July, with the heat spreading further to the northern third of the country. NWS outlooks also repeatedly have predicted above-average national temperatures for the summer overall. \"The weather backdrop is simply bullish,\" Pinebrook Energy Advisors' Andy Huenefeld, managing partner, told NGI during bidweek. Several natural gas hubs in California and the Southwest, where scorching temperatures were widespread over the final days of June and forecasted to sizzle further in coming weeks, propelled the overall increase during bidweek. Those regions also are dependent in part on gas from the Permian Basin, where maintenance work amid pipeline constraints in June limited supplies flowing west. SoCal Citygate surged $1.335 month/month to average $3.055, and SoCal Border Avg. jumped $1.235 to $2.565. In the Southwest, KRGT Del Pool spiked $1.150 to $2.740, while El Paso S. Mainline/N. Baja rose $1.400 to $2.600. Futures prices, however, struggled in late June as traders fixated on rising production and robust inventories of gas stored underground. Production consistently held around 100 Bcf/d late last month, rising from spring lows in the mid-90s Bcf/d, according to Wood Mackenzie. The firm on Monday estimated output at 100 Bcf/d. At the same time, supplies in storage remained abundant. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported an injection of 52 Bcf for the week ended June 21. The increase boosted inventories to 3,097 Bcf and put stocks 21% above the five-year average of 2,569 Bcf. The futures market \"is a little bit in a wait-and-see mode, wanting to actually witness the July heat develop as forecasted,\" StoneX Financial Inc.'s Thomas Saal, senior vice president of energy, told NGI. \"Because if that heat doesn't come through, we're going to be sitting on a lot of gas.\" Futures Pressure On the final day of the latest bidweek period, the July Nymex natural gas futures contract rolled off the board with a 12.8-cent loss. It settled at $2.628 on that Wednesday, down 3% from the prior week's close. It had lost ground the previous week as well. The August contract moved to the front of the curve last Thursday and fell 6.0 cents in that session and another 8.4 cents the following day. On Monday, it settled at $2.478, down 12.3 cents. \"We remain focused on rising natural gas production in mid-summer as drillers return deferred supply to the market,\" said EBW Analytics Group's Eli Rubin, senior analyst. Any \"downturn in cooling demand could send gas tumbling.\" Still, Rubin noted the forecasts point to solid demand ahead, and on the storage front, the surplus to the five-year average has narrowed over the past two months. With the latest EIA print, the surfeit declined by two percentage points. It has been cut in half since topping 40% in March. If that continues alongside scorching mid-summer conditions, he said, futures could rally. \"In the most likely scenario, record July heat may reinforce support for gas prices, whittle down storage surpluses, and allow\" the August contract \"to rebound towards $3.00 in the near-to-medium term.\" Catalysts Ahead While rising production creates a bearish undercurrent to watch closely, Rubin also noted that several new LNG facilities are in the works along the Gulf Coast that could double liquefied natural gas demand before the end of this decade. The first of them could open later this year, launching the trend. Notably, in late June, Texas Eastern Transmission LP began feeding gas to a pending Venture Global LNG Inc. export terminal through Gator Express in Louisiana. The initial test volumes to Plaquemines LNG indicated the facility was on track \"to start exporting in late 2024,\" Wood Mackenzie analyst Nadeem Ahmed said. Rubin described the testing as \"a momentous\" for Venture Global LNG. \"The speed of the near-term ramp up at Plaquemines may offer sufficient demand for natural gas to ward off oversupply later this year,\" he said. Wood Mackenzie data showed gas flows to LNG export facilities at 12.5 Bcf on Monday, up from an average of 12 Bcf/d last week. In the near term, NWS forecasts showed hotter-than-normal high temperatures from the upper 80s to 100s canvassing large swaths of the country from the Southwest to the East Coast this week. \"The first week of July marks the approximate six weeks of the year that typically bring the hottest conditions to most of the nation,\" said AccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski. \"When temperatures exceed the historical average even by a few degrees this time of the year, the heat can be dangerous.\" For the second week of July, highs from the 80s to low 90s were expected to spread over northern markets, while temperatures in the upper 80s to 100s were predicted to remain prevalent throughout southern areas. That would mark a continuation from late June. Strong heat in the final week of the month was expected to result in a seasonally light storage injection with the next EIA report on Wednesday - a day earlier than usual this week because of the Fourth of July holiday on Thursday. Preliminary injection estimates submitted to Reuters for the week ended June 28 ranged from 13 Bcf to 76 Bcf, with an average of 41 Bcf. NGI modeled a build of 29 Bcf. That compares with a five-year average increase of 69 Bcf. With those bullish factors in play, NGI's Patrick Rau, senior vice president of Research & Analysis, said Monday that futures were \"well into oversold territory now.\" However, he added, since the August contract fell below $2.50, \"there could be some follow-on selling down toward the next technical support level in the $2.40 range.\" Related Tags natural gas production weather Kevin Dobbs Kevin Dobbs joined the staff of NGI in April 2020.

    "Content": "OPEC: Global crude oil demand will rise to 116m bpd in 2045 - TV360 Nigeria The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) says world demand for oil is projected to rise to an estimated 116 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2045. Haitham Al Ghais, OPEC secretary-general, spoke on Tuesday in Abuja at the ongoing 23rd Nigerian Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week Conference and Exhibition. The conference is themed 'Showcasing Opportunities, Driving Investment, Meeting Energy Demand'. Addressing the conference via teleconference, Al Ghais said the world economy is expected to double in size - growing from $138 trillion in 2023 to $270 trillion in 2045. He explained that the oil cartel forecasted a rapidly expanding world population that would surpass 9.5 billion people. \"Why are we optimistic? Let us consider these statistics, which are based on OPEC's World Oil Outlook,\" he said. \"Urbanisation alone will account for over half a billion people moving to cities around the world by 2030. Al Ghais said in the upcoming years, the industry will need to significantly increase investment levels in order to keep up with the rapid and robust growth in energy consumption. He said according to its research, the total oil-related investment requirements between 2024 and 2045 would be $14 trillion or about $610 billion on average per year. \"Securing this vital funding is essential to maintaining security of supply and avoiding unwanted volatility,\" Al Ghais said. \"In spite of these facts, I am certain you are aware of some recent predictions for peak demand by 2030 and calls for a discontinuation of investment in hydrocarbons.\" Al Ghais pledged that OPEC and its member countries would keep pushing to advocate for a fair process for adaptation, mitigation and means of implementation with regard to climate finance and technology. The secretary-general said an estimated 675 million people lack access to basic forms of energy and 2.3 billion without access to clean cooking fuels. Al Ghais, while commending President Bola Tinubu, appreciated Nigeria's unwavering commitment to OPEC and the declaration of cooperation (DoC).

Data provided by intelligence firm Vortexa showed this. As per data, India imported 2.13 million barrels of crude oil per day from Russia last month, up 7.2% from the previous month. This was the highest since May 2023 when imports from Russia stood at 2.15 million barrels per day. Imports of Urals reached their all-time high 1.6 million barrels per day in June. 'India's imports of Urals have reached an all-time high, never on record did Indian refiners buy more than 1.6 million b/d. India has resumed purchases of Russian grades from the Far East such as ESPO or Sokol, however the quantities thereof are lower than they were on average in 2023,' said Viktor Katona, lead crude analyst at Kpler. Also Read: UPI transactions surge 49 per cent to 13.89 billion in June The share of US crude in India oil imports also increased by 75% sequentially to 371,000 barrels per day last month. India imported more than 370,000 b/d of oil from the US in June, the highest since January 2023. Meanwhile, import volumes from Iraq and Saudi Arabia, the other top suppliers of crude oil to India, declined by 24% and 25% on month respectively. June imports from Saudi Arabia came in at a mere 430,000 barrels per day, the lowest monthly figure since January 2014.

    "Content": "India's crude oil imports from Russia at 12-month high in June - The Hindu BusinessLine India's crude oil imports from Russia at 12-month high in June Updated - July 02, 2024 at 10:19 PM. Crude oil imports from Russia up by 15 per cent month-on-month, 2 per cent year-on-year By Rishi Ranjan Kala Comments Share Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppReddit READ LATER Remove See All India's crude oil imports from Russia rose to 1.97 million barrels per day (mbpd) during June 2024, the highest since July 2023, largely due to lower cargoes to China.According to data from energy intelligence firm Vortexa, imports from Russia were up by almost 15 per cent month-on-month and 2 per cent on an annual basis. Data shows that both public and private sector refiners continued to import in record quantities from Russia.Public refiners such as Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) imported 1.10 mbpd crude oil, which is also a 12-month high. The cargoes last month were higher by 6 per cent M-o-M. However, imports were down by almost 11 per cent on an annual basis. During May-July 2023, public refiners imported more than 1.2 mbpd on a monthly basis from Russia.Private refiners Reliance Industries (RIL) and Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy imported a record 871,200 barrels per day (bpd) from Russia in June 2024. The cargoes were higher by 28 per cent M-o-M and 20 per cent Y-o-Y. Also read Crude oil up as market expects demand boost during US travel season Consumption of transport fuels declines in June, after May's record high End of petrodollar? We wouldn't hold our breath Vortexa's head of APAC analysis Serena Huang told businessline , \"India's imports of Russian crude at 1.97 mbpd in June 2024 is the highest since last July. China's lower appetite of Russian crude has led to more barrels heading to India.\" Import momentum India's crude imports have remained robust at 4.62 mbpd in June, Huang said. \"We expect the country's crude imports to remain robust, with downside risks from softer refining margins due to slowing global oil demand,\" she added. While Indian refiners procured more barrels from Russia, cargoes from traditional suppliers in West Asia, such as Iraq and Saudi Arabia, declined.Crude oil imports from India's second largest supplier, Iraq, fell by 20 per cent M-o-M and by 3.5 per cent Y-o-Y to roughly 754,000 bpd in June 2024. The decline was steeper in in-bound shipments from Saudi Arabia at 36 per cent M-o-M and 46 per cent Y-o-Y to around 387,000 bpd. Some trade sources said that the higher official selling price (OSP) of its flagship medium sour grade Arab Light in June could have been a reason for the lower cargoes. Crude oil shipments from the US continued to rise for the second consecutive month in June 2024. India imported roughly 331,000 bpd from the US last month, compared to around 224,000 bpd in May 2024 and 112,000 bpd in April. Trade sources said the imports were of light sweet grade due to weak market fundamentals amid refinery outages in Europe.
