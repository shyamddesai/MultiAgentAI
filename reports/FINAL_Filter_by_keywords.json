(Mark Thiessen/AP/CP) The Biden administration is wasting no time making use of a new conservation rule for the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. It's asking for public comment on whether to add acreage to the \"special areas\" of the reserve, where oil and gas development is restricted. The reserve is a tract of federal land in the Western Arctic that's the size of Indiana. About half of it is in special areas, designated as valuable for migratory birds, caribou and marine mammals that use it, and for subsistence hunting. The government finalized a rule in April that calls for maximum protection of resources in these areas. The rule also says the government can review the designations and consider changing their borders or adding new special areas. Possibility of new restrictions The Bureau of Land Management's announcement Friday of a 60-day comment period is the first step toward toward possibly expanding the special areas or adding more restrictions. Despite its name, which reflects the federal government's original interest in the land, the petroleum reserve is a key battleground for environmental groups and for advocates of the oil industry. It is the site of oilfields ConocoPhillips is developing as part of its massive Willow project, which the new rule does not block. National environmental groups cheered today's announcement. The state of Alaska, ConocoPhillips and a North Slope advocacy group called Voice of the Arctic Inupiat has lawsuits underway seeking to overturn the new NPR-A rule.

China used to import more than a third of its oil supplies from Africa but by 2022, that figure had dropped to about one-tenth, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), an online data platform. According to Carnegie's report entitled 'How Is China's Economic Transition Affecting its Relations with Africa?', between 2019 and 2023, there were dramatic increases in China's imports of oil from Malaysia (408%), the UAE (254%), Kazakhstan (214%) and Kuwait (41%). By contrast, during the same period, all eight major African oil producers, except Chad, earned much less than they did before the pandemic, according to the report. Angola has fallen down the list from being China's No. 2 source of crude oil a decade ago to the eighth place in the ranking today. The sharp declines in China's oil imports from Angola, but also South Sudan (77%), Sudan (67%) and Nigeria (61%), for example, have been due to a number of factors, observers say, including geopolitical considerations, lack of investment in equipment and new oil fields and domestic political problems. As China's oil imports from Africa decline, it is increasingly turning to the more predictable production infrastructure of the Gulf countries and Russia and other Asian countries, according to the report from the Washington-based think tank.

Chinese economic data, including disappointing GDP growth and declining refinery output, raises concerns about oil demand. The focus shifts from supply concerns in the US to demand worries in China. Technical analysis suggests potential for a triple bottom pattern in oil prices, with key support and resistance levels identified. Most Read: The Week Ahead - ECB Spotlight as Fed Rate Speculations Drive Market Shifts Oil prices remained resilient this morning following a turbulent weekend. An attack on US Presidential hopeful Donald Trump has seen the US Dollar start the week on the front foot but Oil prices have held firm. Data out of China this morning stoked fears around demand once more, something which market participants had hoped was in the rearview mirror. The overall fundamental picture remains largely positive but demand concerns may hamper any further gains in the short-term. Chinese Data China's GDP data released this morning was disappointing as sluggish domestic demand bites. The data prompted several investment banks to lower their GDP forecasts. GDP growth slowed to 0.7% quarter-on-quarter (q/q) seasonally adjusted (SA) in Q2, down from 1.6% q/q in Q1 and below market expectations of 0.9%, impacted by slower retail sales growth. Domestic demand and consumer confidence remain weak, with the NBS also attributing the slowdown to extreme weather events and flooding. Although industrial output growth is cooling, it exceeded market expectations, highlighting the uneven nature of China's recovery. Strong exports are supporting manufacturing activity, with shipments rising 8.6% year-on-year (y/y) in June, up from 7.6% in May. The secondary industry, which includes manufacturing and construction, grew by 5.6% y/y in Q2, down from 6.0% in Q1, while the tertiary industry, or services, increased by 4.2%, down from 5.0%. Chinese GDP Q2 YoY Source: LSEG (click to enlarge) Chinese refinery output declined for the third consecutive month due to planned maintenance and weak fuel demand, leading independent plants to reduce production. Output for the first half of the year was down 0.4% compared to the same period last year, indicating a sluggish economic recovery and reduced processing profits for refineries. Crude oil imports for the month of June dropped 11% while H1 imports were down 2.3% YoY. According to the IEA the Chinese share of global oil demand growth is declining to 40% this year from last year's 70%. This decline in China has reignited worries about demand, a notable shift from the past two weeks where supply concerns were prevalent in the US. The Week Ahead Oil inventory data is very important as the US and Europe are currently in the middle of summer. This period is typically the peak driving season in the US, leading to high demand for petroleum and other oil-related products. Due to the busy summer season in the US, there is a good chance that weekly oil inventories will decrease more than expected. This could help keep oil prices strong and prevent any significant long-term price drops. Geopolitics also remains a concern and could once more play an important role in the absence of high impact US economic data. For all market-moving economic releases and events (GMT-Time), see the MarketPulse Economic Calendar. (click to enlarge) Technical Analysis Oil prices snapped a four week winning streak to close around 2.33% lower. The weekly timeframe has price testing the 100-day MA which could prove to be a stern area of resistance. The daily timeframe is even more interesting as it appears markets could be setting up a triple bottom pattern. Such a pattern would no doubt embolden bulls eyeing further appreciation in oil prices. A daily candle close below the 85.25 handle opens up a potential selloff in Brent crude with support levels at 83.50 and 82.50 coming into focus. Immediate resistance rests at 86.21 with a break above carrying oil toward 87.90 and potentially the 90.00 psychological level.

I agreeI declineChange my preferences US Europe Arab Asia Africa | Politics Economy Oil&Energy Entertainment Sport Cambodia sees 22 percent increase in imports of diesel fuel, petroleum oils Date 7/16/2024 9:06:09 AM Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter (MENAFN) In the first half of 2024, Cambodia saw a significant increase in its imports of diesel fuel and petroleum oils, as reported by the Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday. The total value of these imports reached 1.27 billion U.S. dollars during the January-June period, marking a 22 percent rise from the 1.04 billion dollars recorded in the same period last year. The report detailed that Cambodia spent approximately 757.5 million dollars on diesel fuel and 512.5 million dollars on petroleum oils during this timeframe. This represents a 16 percent increase in spending on diesel fuel and a substantial 31 percent rise in expenditure on petroleum oils compared to the previous year.Cambodia's complete reliance on imported diesel fuel and petroleum oils stems from the fact that the country's seabed oil reserves remain untapped. The Ministry of Mines and Energy has projected that the demand for oil products in Cambodia will grow significantly, predicting an increase to 4.8 million tons by 2030 from 2.8 million tons in 2020. On Tuesday, the price of regular gasoline at gas stations was 4,300 riel (approximately 1.05 U.S. dollars) per liter, while diesel was priced at 4,200 riel (around 1.02 dollars) per liter. This rise in import values and fuel costs highlights Cambodia's growing energy needs and the economic impact of its dependency on foreign oil imports.MENAFN16072024000045015839ID1108444926 Legal Disclaimer: MENAFN provides the information \"as is\" without warranty of any kind.

I agreeI declineChange my preferences US Europe Arab Asia Africa | Politics Economy Oil&Energy Entertainment Sport Oil prices surge amid political uncertainty, geopolitical tensions Date 7/16/2024 4:45:28 AM Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter (MENAFN) Oil prices saw a modest increase on Monday as geopolitical uncertainty in the United States and the Middle East outweighed pressures from a stronger dollar and subdued demand in China. brent crude futures edged up by 15 cents, or 0.2 percent, to reach USD85.18 per barrel by 0425 GMT, following a slight decline of 37 cents on Friday. Similarly, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose by 20 cents to USD82.41 per barrel, marking a 0.2 percent gain.The attempted assassination of U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump earlier in the week contributed to market uncertainty, according to Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG. This event has cast a shadow over the political landscape of a deeply divided country as it approaches the election period, potentially influencing market sentiment.Geopolitical risks in the Middle East also played a role in supporting oil prices, highlighting ongoing concerns about regional stability. Furthermore, the market remains bolstered by the continuing supply cuts by OPEC+ members. Iraq's oil ministry has pledged to counter any excess oil production starting from 2024, indicating a commitment to manage global supply levels amidst market fluctuations.Despite these factors, oil prices had faced downward pressure last week. Brent crude had declined by more than 1.7 percent after four consecutive weeks of gains, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures dropped by 1.1 percent. This decline was attributed to weak demand for oil in China, the largest importer of crude globally, where crude oil imports fell by 2.3 percent in the first half of the year to 11.05 million barrels per day. Factors contributing to this decline included disappointing fuel demand and reduced output by independent refiners amid narrow profit margins.China's economic slowdown in the second quarter, exacerbated by challenges such as a prolonged property downturn and job market instability, has raised expectations for additional stimulus measures from Beijing to bolster domestic demand. These developments are closely monitored by market participants for potential implications on global oil consumption and economic recovery trends.

This accounts for 17.3% of the total crude oil exports from the ports of these two seas. In total, 19 out of 100 tankers with crude oil from the Baltic and 4 out of 29 tankers from the Black Sea arrived in Turkey. To estimate this in monetary terms, you can do the following simple arithmetic: 2.4 million tons * 7.3 = 17.52 million barrels * $79.58 = $1.4 billion USD (per month).However, that is not all - unlike India, Turkey is the absolute champion in the sea import of Russian petroleum products (in addition to crude oil - diesel fuel, etc.). In May 2024, Turkey imported - according to our own monitoring - 2.3 million tons of petroleum products from Russian ports of the Baltic Sea (0.7 million tons) and the Black Sea (1.6 million tons). This represents 37.7% of the total export of petroleum products from Russian ports in these two seas.The number of tankers with Russian petroleum products received by Turkish ports in May 2024 might shock an unprepared reader: 83 from the Black Sea and 16 from the Baltic. Out of these 99 tankers, 35 were Russian.By the way, after the start of the Great War, Turkey doubled its average monthly import figures in 2022, and then even tripled or quadrupled them. And now not only oil market specialists are asking the rhetorical question: did the use of low-quality Russian diesel fuel triple in Turkey? Or is it something else?Let's add another topic that raises many questions. For a year now, since July 2023, Turkey has been pushing for the resumption of the \"Black Sea Grain Initiative\" (the same one - with the participation of the UN, Russia, and Turkey, from which Russia demonstratively withdrew), although an alternative has been successfully operating all this time - the Ukrainian sea export corridor (without the UN, without Russia, and without Turkey).Why the Turkish president needs this, no one can understand. It remains to be assumed that:a) the Turkish leader knows something about Russia's plans to attack ships heading to the ports of Greater Odesa via the Ukrainian corridor, orb) he is fulfilling the request of Emperor Pu, who certainly does not like that ships on their way to Ukrainian ports are no longer inspected.Yes, we appreciate that Turkey has closed its straits to Russian warships. And we haven't forgotten about the Bayraktars. But...As we noted a few days ago - ALL \"peacemaker\" countries - those that exist and those that will appear - simply have business with Putin's Russia. And they are not concerned about peace. They are concerned about their banks already feeling the strain - otherwise, soon they will have to somehow wind down their business with the aggressor country.

    "Content": "Crude oil falls after weak Chinese growth - London Business News | Londonlovesbusiness.com Tech Property Business London Loves Home Business News Crude oil falls after weak Chinese growth IMAGO/Westlight / Avalon Business NewsEconomic NewsFinance NewsInvestment News Crude oil falls after weak Chinese growth by Antonio Ernesto Di Giacomo Market Analyst Latam at XS.com July 16, 2024 written by Antonio Ernesto Di Giacomo Market Analyst Latam at XS.com 16 th Jul 24 10:26 am Crude oil prices fell slightly on Monday as weak Chinese data raised doubts about the growth of this significant economy. The slowdown in the world's second-largest economy has caused investors' concern, impacting global crude oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell from the market opening, dropping from $81.20 to $80.45 per barrel. Meanwhile, Brent crude also declined, trading at $83.80 per barrel. These drops reflect market concerns over China's economic weakness, a country that plays a crucial role in global oil demand. The world's second-largest economy recorded its weakest year-on-year growth in the second quarter. Forecasts indicated a 5.1% growth, but actual growth was 4.7%. This figure surprised analysts and generated uncertainty about China's ability to maintain its growth pace shortly. Additionally, China's crude oil imports fell by 2.3% in the first half of this year, standing at 11.05 million barrels per day. This decrease in imports is due to disappointing fuel demand, suggesting that economic activity in the country is not as robust as expected. These data indicate that China faces increasing economic headwinds, likely a bad sign for crude oil demand in this vital market. The decline in Chinese demand could have a significant impact on global oil prices, given China's weight in global energy consumption. Losses have been limited as political uncertainty in the United States and the Middle East has supported prices. Despite weak Chinese demand, other geopolitical factors have maintained stability in crude oil prices, preventing more pronounced declines. In conclusion, the weakening of Chinese economic growth has immediately impacted crude oil prices, reflecting concerns about future oil demand. Although geopolitical factors have limited declines, China's economic situation will remain a key factor to monitor in the coming months to understand the evolution of crude oil prices in the global market.

[www.gdi.com.qa] TEMPO.CO , Jakarta - World oil prices fell on Tuesday, July 16. Reuters reported that Brent crude fell 9 cents, or 0.1 percent, to US$84.76 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 13 cents, or 0.2 percent, to US$81.78 per barrel. Reuters wrote that the drop in global oil prices was due to concerns over declining demand from China amid the country's economic slowdown. In the second quarter of 2024, China's economy grew at a much slower rate than forecast, triggered by a prolonged property downturn and job insecurity. In April-June 2024, China's economy was recorded to have grown 4.7 percent, the slowest since Q1/2023 and below the 5.1 percent estimated in a Reuters poll. China's oil refinery output also fell 3.7 percent in June. The three-month drop in output was due to planned maintenance. Meanwhile, lower refining margins and sluggish fuel demand are prompting independent mills to cut production.Meanwhile, Fed chair Jerome Powell said that U.S. inflation readings in the second quarter of this year slightly increased confidence that the rate of price increases was returning to the central bank's target on a sustainable basis. His statement was interpreted by market players as an indication of a shift to lower interest rates, possibly soon. Lower interest rates are expected to lower borrowing costs, allowing economic activity and oil demand to increase.

Related Stories Dangote, Lokpobiri, NNPC, NUPRC, NMDPRA leadership meet over refinery, crude crisis July 22, 2024 Dangote, NNPC, NUPRC - Bare bottom struggle by Joseph Edgar July 22, 2024 He mentioned that conversations are ongoing to secure more crude from African countries like Angola, Senegal, and Libya, all of which are oil-producing nations. \"We will start importing crude oil from African countries. When we get to those countries, we'll start negotiating with them. We'll start bringing in from there. \"We have just bought from US and Brazil. So I think by next month, we'll expand the scope to most of African countries. \"If we availability in Nigeria, we won't have to turn to these other countries,\" Dangote said.When asked about the timeline for sourcing crude from these African countries, Dangote stated that it could begin as soon as next month. News continues after this ad \"Very soon. I think by next month. You know crude, you have to book two months in advance. So, I'll say October we'll be bringing in from these African countries,\" Dangote responded. Feedstock from US, Brazil According to recent reports, Dangote refinery secured 6 million barrel crude oil from US, which is expected to reach the $19 billion facility by August.In addition, the mega refinery will also receive about 5 million barrel of crude oil from US by September, data from Bloomberg show.Accordingly, Dangote is also sourcing crude from the South American country, Brazil, in the coming months to ramp up production as it sets to commence the supply of petrol to the market this month.The leadership of Dangote has vehemently lamented the unavailability of crude in Nigeria, forcing the oil facility to seek alternatives from other countries. IOCs unable to supply local refineries Despite being a leading oil producer, Nigeria still struggles to meet its OPEC quota as well as supply local refineries in the country.Some local refineries, including Dangote, have accused International Oil Companies (IOCs) of refusal to meet their demands, alleging that these IOCs prefer to sell the crude abroad.In response, the regulatory body of oil in Nigeria, NUPRC, has insisted that the IOCs meet local demands first, before exporting to other African countries. PMS Supply expected in July Moreover, Dangote has said his refinery will supply petrol to local marketers this month.Dangote mentioned that the change in date was due to a slight delay, prompting the shift from the originally proposed June to mid-July.The CEO said the refinery will commence production of petrol between 10 and 15 of July, while supply to local marketers will commence from the third week of the same month. \"We had a bit of delay, but PMS will start coming out by 10 to 15 of July. But then we want to keep it in tank to make sure that it settles. So by third week of July, we'll be able coming out to take it into the market,\" Dangote said.The refinery is expected to significantly reduce Nigeria's dependence on imported petroleum products.

It is not patriotic on the side of the people in government to allow this to happen. Our local refineries ought to get crude first before exporting the excess to other countries. By this action government and NNPC and all regulators concern have proved to us that making money for themselves is more important than Nigeria economy and her citizen s welfare. There should be immediate ban on crude oil exchange or swap for refined products outside Nigeria. If there should be any, it should be given to Dangote Refinery or any of the local Refineries not foreign Refineries.

International benchmark Brent crude traded at $84.23 per barrel at 09.39 a.m. local time (0639GMT), a decline of 0.73% from the closing price of $84.85 per barrel in the previous trading session.The American benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded at $80.22 per barrel at the same time, a 0.77% fall from the previous session that closed at $80.84 per barrel.The gross domestic product (GDP) of China rose by 4.7% in the second quarter of 2024, below market expectations, according to official figures on Monday.The country's economy expanded by 5.3% in the first quarter, and the market forecast was a GDP growth rate of 5.1% in the second quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said.This comes after data last week showed softness in oil imports, according to Daniel Hynes, a commodity strategist at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.\"Over the first six months of the year, the world's top importer bought less crude oil compared with last year. June crude oil imports fell on both a monthly and annual basis to 46.45 million tons,\" Hynes said in an e-mailed note.Hynes also added that a stronger US dollar emerged as investors ratcheted up their bets that former US President Trump would win back the White House, which dented investor appetite. The US dollar index rose by 0.18% to 104.065 at 09.39 a.m. local time (0639GMT), compared to the previous trading session close. The higher US dollar curbs oil demand and supports price declines.Trump was targeted in an assassination attempt during a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, just days before he was set to accept the Republican nomination for a third term.However, increased expectations that the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) interest rate cut will start soon limited further price declines.The Fed is receiving \"more good\" inflation data, paving the way for its first interest rate cut later this year, Chair Jerome Powell said Monday.Speaking at the Economic Club of Washington, DC, Powell reiterated his comments that the US central bank is looking for \"greater confidence\" that inflation is returning to its 2% target.Powell noted the Fed does not need to wait until inflation hits its 2% long-term target to begin lowering interest rates because of the lagging effect of monetary tightening on inflation data.Market players interpreted Powell's remarks as a return to interest rate cuts may not be far off.Lower interest rates are set to reduce the cost of consumer borrowing and stoke expectations of increased economic growth and demand for oil.

Oil Markets Dangote Refinery to Import First Shipment of Brazilian Crude Oil By: Godwin Okafor, The Naija247news Date: July 14, 2024 Nigeria's Dangote refinery is set to receive its first shipment of Brazilian crude oil as it moves towards full operational capacity. This marks a historic purchase for Nigeria, with the refinery importing a one-million-barrel cargo of Brazil's Tupi crude, scheduled for delivery in the latter half of next month.Thank you for reading this post, don't forget to subscribe! The Dangote refinery has been crucial in reducing Nigeria's reliance on imported fuel. Despite being Africa's largest oil producer, Nigeria has historically depended on foreign fuel imports to meet domestic needs due to insufficient refining capacity. By importing crude and refining it locally, Nigeria aims to enhance energy security, reduce import dependency, and lower fuel prices for consumers. Sourcing crude oil from diverse global suppliers will be key to the Dangote refinery's success and Nigeria's broader energy strategy. The Brazilian crude, sold by Petrobras, is one of the most cost-effective and suitable oil grades on the global market. Earlier this week, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) reached an agreement with oil producers to supply crude oil to domestic refineries at market prices, ending a supply dispute that had strained relations with international oil companies. This agreement is part of Nigeria's broader efforts to ensure a stable supply of crude for its refineries, strengthening the country's energy infrastructure and reducing over-reliance on any single source. As Nigeria continues to build its refining capabilities, the Dangote refinery stands at the forefront of this transformative journey.

    "Content": "Oil futures: Crude prices extend losses on economic, demand concerns Oil futures: Crude prices extend losses on economic, demand concerns Crude Oil Refined Products 16 Jul 2024 Quantum Commodity Intelligence - Crude oil futures Tuesday were sliding lower as concerns over broader economic growth offset increasing prospects for a September US rate cut. Front-month Sep24 ICE Brent futures were trading at $83.75/b (1900 GMT), compared to Monday's settle of $84.85/b and an intraday low of $83.30/b. At the same time Aug24 NYMEX WTI was trading at $80.77/b , versus Monday's settle of $81.91/b. Markets remained subdued in the early part of the week despite Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicating that the nation's central bank does not need to see inflation at 2% before cutting rates. \"The implication of that is that if you wait until inflation gets all the way down to 2%, you've probably waited too long, because the tightening that you're doing, or the level of tightness that you have, is still having effects which will probably drive inflation below 2%,\" Powell said in Monday's comments to the Economic Club of Washington, DC. The comments came after last Thursday's lower-than-expected inflation report lifted the prospect of a long-awaited interest rate cut this September, in turn boosting economic growth and oil consumption. China Benchmarks opened the week softer after disappointing GDP figures from China, while crude oil throughput continued to slide last month as thin margins weighed on utilisation rates across the country. The Chinese National Bureau of Statistics data showed Asia's biggest oil refiner processing 58.32 million mt of crude oil in June, equating to 14.19 million bpd. \"The weak economic data in China also weighed on sentiment in the crude oil market. This comes after data last week showed softness in oil imports. Over the first six months of the year,\" said ANZ commodity strategist Daniel Hynes, adding there are also concerns that demand in the US peaked during the 4 July holiday. Elsewhere, investors continue to monitor stop-start ceasefire talks on the Gaza conflict, while Houthi militants have launched three attempted attacks on regional shipping, including an oil tanker, as the Yemen-based group expands its range to the Mediterranean. This included Houthis publishing a video of a uncrewed surface vessel (USV) hitting the crude oil tanker Chios Lion in the Red Sea on 15 July. The North Sea physical market was also in retreat this week as flagship Forties traded in Monday's MOC window at +$0.60/b to the underlying Dated Brent swap on a FOB basis, having last traded at +1/b on Wednesday. twitter linkedin send print Related Total sees higher Q2 output, slump in refinery margins Crude Oil Refined Products 16 Jul 2024 TotalEnergies sees upstream output at the higher end of its second-quarter guidance, the company said Tuesday...

    "Content": "Adapting to change: The unfolding world of e-commerce trade finance | Global Trade Review (GTR) Share this Adapting to change: The unfolding world of e-commerce trade finance Sponsored Statement / 15-07-24 / by GTR Market participants are increasingly using online marketplaces for trade finance services, but existing finance mechanisms are not all adequately positioned to support this growth and their working capital needs. Citi's Pauline Kontos, global head of working capital advisory, treasury and trade solutions (TTS) and Bob Petrie, director, TTS trade partnerships and innovation, discuss the vibrant e-commerce market, what its evolution means from a funding perspective, and how banks are rising to the challenge of supporting the digital trade finance business model to enable e-commerce to thrive. Shopping online is a run-of-the-mill activity for many consumers, with business-to-consumer (B2C) online marketplaces, such as Amazon and eBay, established hubs for digital trade. Business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce, however, is relatively new compared to B2C and the dynamics of this segment are still evolving. As is often the case, online retail developments in the consumer space translate to demand for similar solutions for corporates. As such, B2B marketplaces are gaining real momentum, and so are emerging markets' online sales. For example, Mexico's online sales increased by 24.6% in 2023, while India's surging internet and smartphone usage is driving substantial e-commerce growth, with reported online revenues expected to exceed US$100bn by 2027 . When it comes to supporting merchants, online B2C marketplaces have become almost one-stop shops for the merchants selling on those platforms, with virtually everything needed to run their business taken care of, including payments, marketing, analytics and logistics. As a result, the firms that traditionally provided those services have been disintermediated or less relied upon. This one-stop-shop approach reinforces how online marketplaces are digitally driven and adaptable to needs, requiring a level of technical sophistication in order to plug into them. As both B2C and B2B marketplaces scale, a reassessment of how they are supported and funded is taking place. With the relatively limited balance sheets of the majority of fintechs, there is a need for more robust offerings and lower costs of capital. Large financial services companies are increasingly an important option to help with access to liquidity and funding. Additionally, as regulators increasingly take notice, e-commerce marketplaces are looking for partners with more stringent risk and compliance practices. As such, banks are gearing up to provide the tools to ensure the e-commerce industry's growth prospects can be realised. A dynamic market needs effective support The case for banks to enter the world of e-commerce is clear. Firstly, their financial network will be paramount in providing practical funding to ensure working capital demands can be met as the industry evolves. As online marketplaces grow, merchants operating on these platforms will need to adapt to rising customer demand and their liquidity requirements will increase significantly. Another factor is that e-commerce funding needs tend to expand globally far quicker than the needs of more traditional sectors. With fintechs often restricted by the geography in which they operate, large, international banks are better positioned to support the global reality of the industry. And that extends beyond liquidity bandwidth. While perhaps not as relevant to many merchants when marketplaces were in their infancy, having access to a wider suite of services and solutions - such as cross-border payments and FX capabilities - will become more valuable as the landscape, and their businesses, scale. Elsewhere, regulatory scrutiny is naturally increasing in line with the growth of e-commerce marketplaces. Banks are well versed in regulation and compliance, and can apply effective risk controls within these environments, helping to facilitate the maturing industry in a way that fintechs would unlikely be able to do on their own. Supporting the backbone of e-commerce Supporting this rapidly growing market is not straightforward. Given that global trade has been built upon paper documents and manual processes, traditional financing solutions no longer cater to the needs of online marketplaces and their business models. Indeed, in these digital, fast-paced ecosystems, there is not an invoice or traditional payment term in sight. Traditional trade finance practices, therefore, need to be rapidly adapted to meet the unique requirements of e-commerce. Furthermore, in practical terms, this is not about funding the marketplaces themselves. Supporting these ecosystems means providing trade finance to the merchants using them (as well as the buyers, with respect to B2B marketplaces). These sellers are typically small businesses trying to scale to fulfil the sizeable orders they are receiving as a result of joining a global online marketplace. In contrast, global banks typically work with a multinational corporate client base with strong credit ratings, and merchants' lack of transaction visibility and performance history makes performing credit assessments and providing funding far more challenging. Hence, banks need to understand how they can most effectively navigate this burgeoning trade environment. As a key step, a number of banks are exploring how their existing trade finance products can map to e-commerce finance requirements, collaborating with internal commercial banking teams to leverage their expertise. Working capital loans, inventory finance and warehouse facilities, for example, are proving effective solutions. By applying them in conjunction with a trusted fintech partner, banks can extend these more traditional offerings to smaller businesses. In addition to repositioning their existing product sets, banks are collaborating with fintechs to meet all of the changing needs within e-commerce and provide all of the required skillsets. Citi, for example, recently established a financing arrangement with SellersFi, a global fintech, enabling the bank to extend its offerings to new clients and a whole new market. As banks become more embedded in e-commerce and marketplace financing, collaboration with fintechs is a logical strategy. The fusion of their capabilities - the speed, nimbleness and tech-savviness of fintechs, and the balance sheets, reach, expertise and experience of banks - will ensure the most effective functioning of marketplace environments as they mature and grow. Fast finance for a fast-moving industry Further helping to enable the financing of marketplace sellers is the digital nature of the online marketplaces themselves. These platforms have extensive data points that can help provide valuable insights into the activity of the merchants seeking finance. This digital information can help with integration and credit-scoring models, and underwriting decisions. Certainly, being able to deliver decisions quickly is essential for finance to be effective in this fast-moving environment, where working capital needs can change in a matter of not just weeks or days, but hours, due to a product \"going viral\" and creating spikes in demand. The data that is available through these platforms is also driving changes within lenders' own credit underwriting models, with different variables or \"alternative data\" now being taken into account. This can include, for example, seller ratings and reviews, return rates and trends regarding the speed of converting orders into cash. As the amount of available data grows over time, AI's ability to identify patterns should become ever-stronger - thereby enabling greater understanding of individual business needs, and ultimately creating a truly streamlined, optimised funding process. As banks embark on the journey into e-commerce and adapt to the requirements of the digital trade finance business model, this is setting in motion a new way of thinking and transacting. As business demands evolve, banks will also be challenged to implement innovative strategies across wider markets, with traditional forms of trade finance needing to be translated into a format that can be consumed within digitally native environments. Certainly, significant change is coming and banks, like Citi, are poised to become the funders and facilitators of the future of e-commerce.

    "Content": "Solving the African SME trade finance gap with international collaboration | Global Trade Review (GTR) Share this Solving the African SME trade finance gap with international collaboration Sponsored Statement / 15-07-24 / by GTR It is widely acknowledged and accepted that access to finance remains one of the biggest constraints for the survival and growth of MSMEs. Given that they are the drivers of broad-based economic growth in developing economies, solving this problem is crucial if we are to address the ever-increasing trade finance gap, write George Wilson, head of institutional trade finance, and Derryn Faure, institutional trade finance, at Investec Bank Limited. Notwithstanding that MSMEs are the focus of many multilaterals and development finance institutions (DFIs) across the globe, who genuinely want to help, the trade finance gap in developing markets continues to worsen. In our view, an on-the-ground understanding of developing market MSMEs and their constraints, obtaining practical legal and IT help, liquidity, capital, grants and international collaboration are key to solving the problem. Unfortunately, this will also require an unprecedented level of communication and partnership between MSMEs, African non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), local banks and governments, international banks, fintechs, funds and multilaterals. Some deeply held shibboleths will also have to be discarded along the way. Endogenous cost barriers to entry In previous articles, we have discussed at length how inappropriate regulation has negatively impacted African trade finance, particularly by making it unprofitable for trade financiers. What we have not focused on are the additional prohibitive cost barriers to entry for local African MSME financiers and MSMEs themselves. African MSME financiers tend not to offer technical open account, structured or commodity trade financing products as their product development, implementation, systems, controls and operations require expensive capex and investment, and these banks sensibly won't invest in unprofitable business. This puts 'real' trade finance products, which use self-liquidation and the underlying transactional flows as credit mitigation, beyond the reach of most MSMEs and relegates them to overdrafts and mortgage loans to fund their working capital cycles. Unfortunately, however, most MSME traders just don't have enough tangible security to offer their financiers as collateral. Once small businesses have pledged their fixed property, which most small businesses must do to raise initial capital, they have nothing else to mortgage beyond their underlying inventory and invoices - the very trade products that their banks are deterred from financing. In order to lend to MSMEs, financiers need to take a credit view on those MSMEs' track records by assessing their books and records. Here again, unfortunately, many MSMEs don't maintain usable financial accounting or IT systems as they are not core to their business, and their cost and implementation are prohibitively expensive. However, without serviceable accounting information or systems, the availability of any credit will be negligible and/or prohibitively expensive - we have seen margins north of 25% for dollar funding. As is already evident in the rest of the world, the future of trade finance is open account and digital. Some excellent digital open account trade and accounting systems are already available for this type of African trade finance, but the implementation and testing costs for lower-tier MSME financiers are not financially viable, and the MSMEs can't afford the associated costs, either. Even where open account or structured commodity trade products are available, the standard Loan Market Association-style legal documentation required by financiers is too complicated and overwhelming for most MSME traders, especially since the associated costs (including registration of local law security) are prohibitively expensive for short-term MSME trade facilities. What is needed are simpler and shorter, standardised MSME trade loan agreements and regional security templates - much like the BAFT (Bankers Association for Finance and Trade) Master Trade Loan Agreement - for MSME traders and their financiers. International collaboration As mentioned, DFIs, multilaterals, governments and local and international banks are genuinely desperate to address the trade finance gap and have each independently proposed solutions in the form of guarantee and risk-sharing programmes, implementing policies through MSME ministries as well as supply chain finance (SCF) facilities, for example. However, no material impact has been made as there has been little coordination in implementation, no practical African input and no understanding or consideration of the actual root causes of the problem. Solutions have generally focused on corporate-anchored, digital SCF programmes because they fit the non-African pre-requisites. Critically, the only entities that have the resources and mandate to have a material impact are the DFIs but they insist on crippling extraneous philosophical tenets: They harbour an aversion to leveraging their trade programme resources for working capital as they interpret it as not 'real trade'. But MSMEs often can't access 'real' trade finance products for the reasons mentioned previously; They insist that their assistance is not concessional and must be limited to mobilising private capital to amplify commercial risk takers who have some 'skin in the game'. This is reasonable for corporate trade, but the problem is that no one is taking MSME risk in the first place; Their guarantee and refinance programmes demand all the details of the underlying transactions. Unfortunately, this is impossible for MSME trade finance where there are millions of small, randomly timed MSME invoices, which disqualify international banks due to the regulatory obligation of intolerable risks associated with sanctions and AML screening of millions of underlying past, present and future MSME transactions; and Their requirement for evidence of and adherence to the goals of the Paris Agreement and northern hemisphere ESG sensibilities that they require as a prerequisite of their support. Fragile developing economies seeking a 'just transition' question why they must shoulder the burden of climate action for first-world governments and multilaterals where it's clearly evident that these developing economies only contribute 2/3% to overall global carbon emissions. If solving the African MSME trade gap is really the priority, then all of these tenets must be abandoned. New solutions must be designed, and mandates and terms of reference need to be recommissioned, taking into account MSME-specific challenges and obstacles to successfully support African MSME trade programmes in order to achieve sustainable economic growth in developing markets. Proposed solutions Crucially, the solution to the regulatory challenges depends on the deliberate expansion of DFI and multilateral guarantee programmes to cover aggregated trade portfolios to neutralise their capital and liquidity cost aversion. The guarantees can be made 50% transferable to cover not just the African FIs in the traditional way but also the risk and, therefore, capital costs of the underlying MSMEs, converting trade and working capital into profitable, good business for the African banks. The DFIs will also need to adopt a 'trade not aid' approach by developing 'technical assistance' funds for grants to offset the endogenous legal, accounting, logistics and IT costs for the African MSMEs, NBFIs and banks in addition to its provision of finance/guarantees. This needs to be practical grant funding, not theoretical training. It will be important to give this kind of financial assistance to foster the wellspring of factors, impact funds, microfinance houses, freight forwarders and other NBFIs to develop trade products alongside working capital facilities into the segment. Together with technical assistance grants, DFIs, FIs and impact investors need to develop private equity-funded limited partners to invest directly into these NBFIs, as the first-order trade financiers of MSMEs in Africa. Africa's US$120bn trade gap problem can then be addressed by applying four scaling factors: The aggregation of these trade facilities into African NBFIs and lower-tier African banks' revolving trade portfolios; The aggregation of these aggregators into African top-tier, regional and central banks and international FIs with African FI trade risk appetite; The application of DFI guarantees to leverage tens of millions into hundreds of millions; and The packaging up and securitisation of these DFI-wrapped facilities into revolving programmes of notes, which are then sold to global alternative funds and impact investors as high-yielding, truly sustainable finance investments with their DFI and developmental halos. This transports the risk to international markets, enabling the second aggregation layer of financiers to recycle their African credit limits and multiply the scale of the solutions into billions of dollars. Conclusion The importance of MSMEs and their contribution to inclusive and sustainable economic growth, particularly in developing markets, cannot be ignored. We also cannot keep talking about the problem and not produce scalable, practical, sustainable solutions that strike at the root causes of a problem of this scale and complexity. All of the multilateral and developmental capital, technology, products and relationships required for this manifesto already exist. All that is required is collaboration between all parties to overcome the obstacles. For us to deliver on SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals), it is time we all work together on these practical solutions to reduce the trade finance gap and enable Africans to sustainably trade themselves out of poverty.

    "Content": "US natural gas pipeline ADCC begins commercial operations US natural gas pipeline ADCC begins commercial operations July 12 (Reuters) - Infrastructure firm WhiteWater said on Friday the ADCC pipeline in South Texas started commercial service on July 1, amid surging U.S. liquefied natural gas exports to global markets. The 40-mile pipeline has a capacity to transport about 1.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas to the Cheniere Corpus Christi Liquefaction facility from Whistler Pipeline's Agua Dulce Header in South Texas. Advertisement: The National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC) NGC's HSSE strategy is reflective and supportive of the organisational vision to become a leader in the global energy business. ngc.co.tt ADCC is owned 70% by Whistler Pipeline - a joint venture of WhiteWater and Enbridge - and 30% by a subsidiary of Cheniere. The U.S. is forecast to export a record 12.2 bcfd of natural gas this year. It became the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023 and has stayed ahead of recent leaders Australia and Qatar. WhiteWater said the pipeline provides Cheniere direct access to Permian and Eagle Ford volumes in addition to volumes sourced along the Gulf Coast.

On July 8, the field's production began flowing to the Mellitah oil port through the 250 km Al-Feel - Mellitah oil pipeline. In May 2024, state-owned Mellitah Oil and Gas and Nafusa Oil Operations signed an agreement for the transport, handling, and shipment of crude oil via the Al-Feel - Mellitah pipeline and completed a new shipping line. Production from the field will gradually increase, reaching 8,000 barrels per day by mid-July and 10,000 barrels per day by next August. Over the past few months, NOC has been revitalizing and rehabilitating several production sites with the goal of achieving a production rate of 2 million barrels per day by 2030.

According to Reuters, the $20 billion refinery is currently producing a lower grade of gasoil than anticipated as it awaits the restart of units necessary for producing cleaner fuels. Consequently, the refinery is seeking buyers in neighbouring markets. Related Stories Dangote, Lokpobiri, NNPC, NUPRC, NMDPRA leadership meet over refinery, crude crisis July 22, 2024 Dangote, NNPC, NUPRC - Bare bottom struggle by Joseph Edgar July 22, 2024 In May, gasoil exports from the refinery reached nearly 100,000 barrels per day (bpd), almost doubling April's levels, data from analytics firm Kpler indicated. Most of these exports were directed to other West African countries, with one shipment sent to Spain. However, preliminary data for June shows a significant drop in gasoil volumes, although overall oil product exports, including fuel oil, naphtha, and jet fuel, remained relatively high at 225,000 bpd. Decline in European exports to West Africa \"The refinery has shifted the balance in West Africa,\" impacting European markets, a European distillates trading source told Reuters. Kpler data revealed that EU and UK gasoil exports to West Africa fell to a four-year low of 29,000 bpd in May, while Russian exports to the region dropped to an eight-month low of 87,000 bpd in the same month. Dangote has been selling some high-sulphur gasoil in the Nigerian market, but a dispute has arisen with local fuel retailers over who is responsible for selling the dirtier fuel. News continues after this ad The Petroleum Industry Bill passed in 2021, mandated a sulphur content of 50 parts per million (ppm) to align with the sub-regional ECOWAS standards adopted in 2020. However, the regulator permitted the sale of gasoil with sulphur content above 200 ppm locally from the beginning of the year until June, allowing local refineries and importers more time to comply with the new standard. As European countries, including major hubs like Belgium and the Netherlands, tighten regulations on high-sulphur gasoil exports, cargoes from the Dangote refinery have found markets in regions with more lenient motor fuel standards. More Insights Earlier in May, the Chairman of the Dangote refinery, Aliko Dangote had stated that when fully completed, the refinery will supply product to West and Central African countries as its capacity is too big for Nigeria alone. This decline in gasoil exports from Europe to West Africa confirms earlier reports by Reuters which stated that the refinery has the potential to reduce the $17 billion in oil imports into the continent and even lead to the closure of some European refineries. In 2023, West Africa became the largest regional recipient of Europe's gasoline exports, receiving roughly one-third of the continent's average exports, which totalled 1.33 million barrels per day (bpd).

Integration of newly acquired datasets (geological, geophysical, geochemical) with Sitka Gold data. Geological mapping and prospecting following up on the high grade G2 zone, Contact zone and other highly prospective gold targets. VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / July 3, 2024 / Sitka Gold Corp. (\"Sitka\" or the \"Company\") (TSXV:SIG)(FSE:1RF)(OTCQB:SITKF) is pleased to announce that it has expanded the planned 2024 exploration program at its contiguous, 431 square kilometre RC Gold Project (\"RC Gold\" or the \"Project\") in Yukon to include diamond drilling and additional soil geochemistry surveys, geological mapping, prospecting and data integration and analysis on its newly acquired Clear Creek property (\"Clear Creek\") claims that complete the consolidation of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex (see Figure 1). The Company is currently diamond drilling at RC Gold in conjunction with a planned 15,000 metre drilling program for 2024. \"The accumulation of data from several years of systematic exploration by previous operators on the newly acquired Clear Creek Property has generated several high-quality exploration targets,\" said Cor Coe, Director and CEO of Sitka Gold. \"The newly acquired claims cover at least three intrusion related gold targets that are geologically similar to our developing Blackjack gold deposit and the team is very excited to begin assessing the property by testing the Rhosgobel intrusion, where historical work strongly indicates the potential for the presence of a multi-million ounce gold deposit. Sitka's initial discovery of the Blackjack and Eiger gold deposits came about through a similar process of review and compilation of a large historical database and we see the ability to accelerate the discovery of additional gold deposits by utilizing our growing knowledge of the intrusion-related gold systems in this area in conjunction with the comprehensive Clear Creek data-set as we continue our exploration activities across this emerging mining district.\" The newly consolidated Project includes four high-priority areas that have had previous reverse circulation and/or diamond drilling that require additional drilling. These areas are the Rhosgobel intrusion where historical drilling intersected up to 1.03 g/t gold over 67.1 m , the Contact zone with drill results up to 20.3 g/t gold over 10.7 m , the Bear Paw Breccia which intersected up to 1.87 g/t gold over 42.6 m and the Pukelman intrusion with results of 1.20 g/t gold over 10.0 m (see Figure 2, Table 1). The first target area to be tested is the Rhosgobel Intrusion where shallow historical drilling in 1995 by Kennecott outlined a large area of intrusion related gold mineralization (see Figure 3). Previous drilling at Rhosgobel was limited to a vertical depth of approximately 60 metres. The gold mineralization observed at Rhosgobel is sheeted quartz veins hosted in a megacrystic quartz monzonite similar to the Blackjack deposit located 5 km to the north along the recently discovered Blackjack Mineralized Corridor. The first drill hole will be a step out to drill underneath the mineralized zone intersected in Holes 15 and 16 in shallow reverse circulation drilling (see Figure 4). This will be the first diamond drill hole ever drilled in the Rhosgobel intrusion. Geological interpretation of a steeply dipping mineralized zone is consistent with controls on mineralization observed elsewhere on the property.The Company has recently engaged GroundTruth Exploration to conduct grid based soil sampling in an area south of the Blackjack deposit where prospecting in 2015 identified a highly prospective area. The G2 zone was prospected in 2015 and 13 surface float samples were collected with a range of trace to 43.4 g/t gold (see Figure 5) within mineralized intrusive and metasedimentary rocks. Three other samples returned values of 5.9, 7.2 and 13.6 g/t gold . This area is located approximately 2 km south of the Blackjack gold deposit area, within the Blackjack Mineralized Corridor in proximity to the West Pukelman intrusion. Previous reconnaissance scale soil sampling encountered anomalous gold in soil in the area. The G2 zone is located approximately 1 km west of the Pukelman West intrusion within an extensional corridor containing both the Pukelman and Pukelman West intrusions and several previously reported lamprophyre dykes. The Pukelman West intrusion is located approximately 1.5 km south of the Blackjack deposit where recent drilling has intersected higher-grade mineralization associated with the N-S trending Blackjack fault. The intersection of these structural zones is interpreted by Sitka to be highly prospective for the discovery of additional gold mineralization.Prospecting in 2015 also focused on the Contact zone located at the southern margin of the Pukelman intrusion. Nineteen samples were collected ranging from trace to 166.2 g/t gold . Seven additional samples of mainly quartz vein material taken from float and outcrop assayed above 1.0 g/t gold including 86.0, 31.8, 47.2, 27.4, 18.1, 2.8, and 1.5 g/t gold (see Figure 5). The sampling indicates that the extent of the Contact zone could be much larger than the area previously drilled. Additional mapping and prospecting is planned to refine drill targets in anticipation of drilling this area.Geological mapping and prospecting in the G2 to Pukelman West corridor and along the Blackjack fault mineralized corridor from the Blackjack deposit south through the Pukelman West and Rhosgobel intrusion for additional areas of undiscovered gold mineralization will also be conducted with the goal of identifying additional drill targets.Recently acquired data encompassing the southern portion of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex is being integrated within the Sitka database and plans for drilling additional known areas of mineralization are being developed. Figure 1 - The acquisition of the Clear Creek property now completes Sitka Gold's 100% ownership of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex and adds several underexplored areas that have strong potential for new gold discoveries in addition to four high-quality drill targets. Figure 2 - The purchase of the Clear Creek Property (outlined in yellow boundary) now completes Sitka Gold's ownership of 100% of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex, an area of approximately 8 km x 15 km that includes several known surface intrusions with associated gold mineralization. The newly acquired property contains four highly prospective areas with limited historical drilling and several areas that have produced high-grade surface samples but remain under-explored and undrilled. Figure 3 - Shallow reverse circulation drilling in the Rhosgobel intrusion in 1995 produced numerous intersections of gold mineralization consisting of sheeted quartz veins with megacrystic quartz monzonite. Holes 15 and 16 were drilled in opposite directions at 60 degrees dip intersected mineralization over their entire lengths. The holes intersected 50.3 m grading 1.07 g/t gold and 67.1m of 1.03 g/t gold respectively with both holes ending in mineralization. Figure 4 - Cross-section of previous drilling at Rhosgobel along holes 15 and 16 which ended in mineralization. The first ever diamond drill hole proposed in the Rhosgobel intrusion (PROS-24-A) will step back and drill underneath holes 15 and 16 to test the width of the mineralized zone intersected in 1995. Figure 5 - Prospecting in 2015 was conducted in the G2 zone and the Contact Zone and produced many high-grade results. Additional grid soil sampling (shown in Figure 2) will be conducted in these areas and south where previous soil sampling has been conducted at only wide spacings. Current drilling is expanding the Blackjack deposit to the south towards this highly prospective area.

About the Flagship RC Gold Project The RC Gold Project consists of a 431 square kilometre contiguous district-scale land package located in the heart of Yukon's Tombstone Gold Belt. The project is located approximately 100 kilometres east of Dawson City, which has a 5,000 foot paved runway, and is accessed via a secondary gravel road from the Klondike Highway which is usable year-round and is an approximate 2 hour drive from Dawson City. It is the largest consolidated land package strategically positioned mid-way between Victoria Gold's Eagle Gold Mine - Yukon's newest gold mine which reached commercial production in the summer of 2020 - and Victoria Gold's former producing Brewery Creek Gold Mine.On January 19, 2023 Sitka Gold announced an Initial Mineral Resource Estimate prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\") guidelines for the RC Gold Property of 1,340,000 ounces of gold (1) . The road accessible, pit constrained Mineral Resource is classified as inferred and is contained in two zones: The Blackjack and Eiger deposits. Both of these deposits are at/near surface, are potentially open pit minable and amenable to heap leaching, with initial bottle roll tests indicating that the gold is not refractory and has high gold recoveries of up to 94% with minimal NaCN consumption (see News Release July 13, 2022). The Mineral Resource estimate is presented in the following table at a base case cut-off grade of 0.25 g/t Au: RC Gold Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate COG g/t Au Blackjack Zone Eiger Zone Combined Tonnes 000's Au g/t 0z Au 000's Tonnes 000's Au g/t 0z Au 000's Tonnes 000's Au g/t 0z Au 000's 0.2035,7980.80921 32,5230.45471 68,3210.631,391 0.25 33,743 0.83 900 27,362 0.50 440 61,105 0.68 1,340 0.3031,2820.88885 22,2530.55393 53,5350.741,2790.3529,0650.92860 17,8170.60344 46,8820.801,2030.4026,9750.96833 14,5060.66308 41,4810.861,140Notes Mineral resource estimate prepared by Ronald G. Simpson of GeoSim Services Inc. with an effective date of January 19, 2023. Mineral Resources are classified using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards. The cut-off grade of 0.25 g/t Au is believed to provide a reasonable margin over operating and sustaining costs for open-pit mining and processing Mineral resources are constrained by an optimised pit shell using the following assumptions: US $1800/oz Au price; a 45 degrees pit slope; assumed metallurgical recovery of 85%; mining costs of US$2.00 per tonne; processing costs of US$8.00 per tonne; G&A of US$1.50/t. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. Totals may not sum due to rounding. To date, 56 diamond drill holes have been drilled into this system for a total of approximately 19,962 metres including 16 drill holes totalling 6,515 metres completed in 2023 focused on expanding the initial resource. The drilling in 2023 produced results of up to 219.0 m of 1.34 g/t gold including 124.8 m of 2.01 g/t gold and 55.0 m of 3.11 g/t gold in drill hole DDRCCC-23-047 at Blackjack (see news release dated September 26, 2023). The Company is currently diamond drilling at RC Gold in conjunction with a planned 15,000 metre drilling program. Simpson, R. January 19, 2023.

The three new island rigs will operate on existing and newly constructed innovative artificial islands at the offshore Zakum field for drilling and completion of wells. The rigs, which will be constructed by Honghua Group (HH), will incorporate industry leading technology and automation. Delivery of the rigs and commencement of operations is expected during 2026. The rigs will be designed and built as part of a partnership between ADNOC Drilling and HH. This partnership has been specifically formed to harness the transformative nature of AI, digitization, and advanced technology in the design and operation of these next generation drilling rigs. ADNOC Drilling and HH will look to also collaborate with AIQ, an Abu Dhabi based artificial intelligence (AI) pioneer contributing to the energy sector globally. The design of the rig operating systems will look to utilize real-time condition, performance and utilization data to create actionable insights, enhancing rig performance and increasing efficiency, leading to improvements in safety and well delivery times. Additionally, drilling operations on ADNOC's innovative artificial islands create the ideal conditions for extended reach drilling (ERD) with the top five longest wells in the world being delivered from these islands off the coast of Abu Dhabi, the most recently delivered being over 52,000 feet. The rigs will be built to deliver ERD as well as having the state-of-the-art capability of walking between wells eliminating the need for the rigs to be dismantled to be moved. These capabilities dramatically improve efficiency and safety while vastly reducing costs and emissions. The ADNOC Drilling fleet is now expected to total at least 148 by 2026, including these three new rigs, as well as the previously announced three land rigs for the initial phase of unconventional development. Abdulrahman Abdulla Al Seiari, Chief Executive Officer of ADNOC Drilling, said, \"ADNOC Drilling is honored to receive this substantial award, which marks a significant milestone in our company's accelerated growth journey. These new island rigs will be the most advanced in the world, embracing artificial intelligence, the most transformative technology of our generation. \"Our partnership with HH will amplify the creativity and ingenuity of our industry as we design and build these rigs of the future that drive efficiency and safety and deliver exceptional value for our customer ADNOC Offshore.\" Commenting on the award, Tayba Abdul Rahim Al Hashemi, Chief Executive Officer of ADNOC Offshore, said: \"ADNOC Drilling's technical expertise and enhanced capabilities are key enablers as we safely and sustainably accelerate to meet the world's growing energy demands.

    "Content": "Environmental coalition opposes Challenger Energy's bid to renew offshore drilling licenses - Eye Witness News NASSAU, BAHAMAS - A coalition of environmental organizations and businesses has strongly opposed Challenger Energy Group's attempt to renew its offshore drilling licenses. \"Our Islands, Our Future (OIOF),\" a coalition of over 150 businesses, environmental groups, tourism advocates, and other Bahamian and international leaders, stated yesterday that it strongly opposes Challenger Energy Group's recent suggestion that the Bahamian government may renew offshore drilling licenses that expired over three years ago. The coalition stressed that the government's previous decision to halt consideration of these renewals sends a clear message that The Bahamas is shifting away from fossil fuels and embracing a sustainable energy future. Challenger Energy Group, formerly known as The Bahamas Petroleum Company (BPC), continues its efforts to secure the renewal of its licenses for a third three-year exploration period. The company is currently engaged in ongoing discussions with the Government regarding the renewal terms. Eytan Uliel, Chief Executive of Challenger Energy, noted in the company's 2023 annual report and financial statement: \"In relation to the Company's licenses in The Bahamas, throughout 2023 we continued to pursue a renewal of the licenses into a third exploration period. In parallel, we explored various alternative strategies to monetize those assets. The process has been frustratingly slow, but we expect to make better progress in the coming 12 months.\" The report also noted that under its Bahamian exploration licenses, the company must pay the government in advance for annual rentals in the licensed areas. Following the Environmental Authorization for the Perseverance-1 well on February 27, 2020, discussions between the company and the Government of The Bahamas seeking a final agreement on the amount of license fees payable for the remainder of the second exploration period (including the extension due to force majeure) have lacked substantive progress to date. \"The fact that the government has not renewed or considered these licenses is a positive indication that The Bahamas is looking toward a cleaner, greener future,\" said Andurah Daxon, Executive Director of Waterkeepers Bahamas. \"We cannot afford to jeopardize our marine environment and coastal ecosystems for uncertain oil prospects.\" Earlier this year, OIOF commissioned a nationwide poll revealing overwhelming public support for a permanent ban on oil drilling in Bahamian waters. The extensive survey showed that 86 percent of respondents support legislative action to prevent further fossil fuel exploration, with 74 percent advocating for a transition to renewable energy. Of the more than 400 respondents, only four percent opposed a ban on oil drilling, and nine percent were undecided. \"The Bahamian people have spoken loud and clear. They want to protect our pristine waters and vibrant marine life, which are the lifeblood of our tourism and fishing industries,\" said Casuarina McKinney-Lambert, Executive Director of the Bahamas Reef Environment Educational Foundation (BREEF). \"The path forward for the Bahamas is not through fossil fuels but through sustainable energy solutions. The recent oil spill off Clifton underscores the urgency to clean up existing sources of marine pollution and transition to a renewable future.\" According to OIOF, the exploration licenses referenced in Challenger Energy Group's 2023 annual report expired in 2021, and based on available information, the company still owes government fees associated with those licenses. Therefore, the groups emphasize that it is dangerously misleading to state, \"Challenger Energy holds four exploration licenses offshore in The Bahamas.\" This discrepancy further underscores the need for the government to take decisive action and permanently deny these renewal requests. \"The government's refusal to consider renewal based on non-payment of license fees was an important step, and three years have now gone by since those licenses expired,\" said Chris Wilke of Waterkeeper Alliance. \"With Challenger still knocking at the door, a permanent ban on oil drilling would provide the strongest possible assurance of the Bahamian commitment to safeguarding the marine environment and embracing a clean energy future.\" OIOF asserts that The Bahamas has a unique opportunity to lead the Caribbean region to reject dirty fossil fuel proliferation, transition to renewable energy, and set an example for sustainable development and environmental stewardship. OIOF urges the government to prioritize the long-term health and prosperity of the nation by formally denying exploration renewal requests, rejecting any further oil exploration licenses, and committing to a future powered by clean, renewable energy.

The three new island rigs will operate on existing and newly constructed innovative artificial islands at the offshore Zakum field for drilling and completion of wells. The rigs, which will be constructed by Honghua Group (HH), will incorporate industry leading technology and automation. Delivery of the rigs and commencement of operations is expected during 2026. The rigs will be designed and built as part of a partnership between ADNOC Drilling and HH. This partnership has been specifically formed to harness the transformative nature of AI, digitization, and advanced technology in the design and operation of these next generation drilling rigs. ADNOC Drilling and HH will look to also collaborate with AIQ, an Abu Dhabi based artificial intelligence (AI) pioneer contributing to the energy sector globally. The design of the rig operating systems will look to utilize real-time condition, performance and utilization data to create actionable insights, enhancing rig performance and increasing efficiency, leading to improvements in safety and well delivery times. Additionally, drilling operations on ADNOC's innovative artificial islands create the ideal conditions for extended reach drilling (ERD) with the top five longest wells in the world being delivered from these islands off the coast of Abu Dhabi, the most recently delivered being over 52,000 feet. The rigs will be built to deliver ERD as well as having the state-of-the-art capability of walking between wells eliminating the need for the rigs to be dismantled to be moved. These capabilities dramatically improve efficiency and safety while vastly reducing costs and emissions. The ADNOC Drilling fleet is now expected to total at least 148 by 2026, including these three new rigs, as well as the previously announced three land rigs for the initial phase of unconventional development. Abdulrahman Abdulla Al Seiari, Chief Executive Officer of ADNOC Drilling, said, \"ADNOC Drilling is honored to receive this substantial award, which marks a significant milestone in our company's accelerated growth journey.

The first diamond drilling in Rhosgobel Intrusion since 1995 aims to extend findings from historical drilling. Soil sampling and geological mapping are underway to explore high-potential zones south of the Blackjack deposit and the newly acquired Clear Creek claims. Previous exploration data indicates multiple gold targets with promising results, setting the stage for potentially significant discoveries. Positive Initiation of the 2024 exploration program at Clear Creek, including diamond drilling. First diamond drilling at Rhosgobel Intrusion since 1995 aims to extend historical gold findings. Integration of extensive historical datasets to accelerate new gold discoveries. Geochemical surveys and geological mapping to explore high-potential zones for gold deposits. Positive historical drilling results with significant gold intersections at multiple targets. Negative None of the historically reported assay results from Clear Creek have been verified by Sitka. 07/03/2024 - 08:30 AM 2024 exploration has begun on the newly acquired Clear Creek property First diamond drilling program ever to be completed on the Rhosgobel Intrusion since historical shallow reverse circulation drilling in 1995 to follow up on holes 95-15 which intersected 50.3 m of 1.07 g/t gold and 95-16 which intersected 67.1 m of 1.03 g/t gold with both holes ending in strong gold mineralization. Grid geochemistry currently underway to infill gaps to the south of the Blackjack deposit on the high potential Pukelman West intrusion and G2 zone on the newly acquired Clear Creek claims. Integration of newly acquired datasets (geological, geophysical, geochemical) with Sitka Gold data. Geological mapping and prospecting following up on the high grade G2 zone, Contact zone and other highly prospective gold targets. VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / July 3, 2024 / Sitka Gold Corp. (\"Sitka\" or the \"Company\") (TSXV:SIG)(FSE:1RF)(OTCQB:SITKF) is pleased to announce that it has expanded the planned 2024 exploration program at its contiguous, 431 square kilometre RC Gold Project (\"RC Gold\" or the \"Project\") in Yukon to include diamond drilling and additional soil geochemistry surveys, geological mapping, prospecting and data integration and analysis on its newly acquired Clear Creek property (\"Clear Creek\") claims that complete the consolidation of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex (see Figure 1). The Company is currently diamond drilling at RC Gold in conjunction with a planned 15,000 metre drilling program for 2024. \"The accumulation of data from several years of systematic exploration by previous operators on the newly acquired Clear Creek Property has generated several high-quality exploration targets,\" said Cor Coe, Director and CEO of Sitka Gold. \"The newly acquired claims cover at least three intrusion related gold targets that are geologically similar to our developing Blackjack gold deposit and the team is very excited to begin assessing the property by testing the Rhosgobel intrusion, where historical work strongly indicates the potential for the presence of a multi-million ounce gold deposit. Sitka's initial discovery of the Blackjack and Eiger gold deposits came about through a similar process of review and compilation of a large historical database and we see the ability to accelerate the discovery of additional gold deposits by utilizing our growing knowledge of the intrusion-related gold systems in this area in conjunction with the comprehensive Clear Creek data-set as we continue our exploration activities across this emerging mining district.\" The newly consolidated Project includes four high-priority areas that have had previous reverse circulation and/or diamond drilling that require additional drilling. These areas are the Rhosgobel intrusion where historical drilling intersected up to 1.03 g/t gold over 67.1 m , the Contact zone with drill results up to 20.3 g/t gold over 10.7 m , the Bear Paw Breccia which intersected up to 1.87 g/t gold over 42.6 m and the Pukelman intrusion with results of 1.20 g/t gold over 10.0 m (see Figure 2, Table 1). The first target area to be tested is the Rhosgobel Intrusion where shallow historical drilling in 1995 by Kennecott outlined a large area of intrusion related gold mineralization (see Figure 3). Previous drilling at Rhosgobel was limited to a vertical depth of approximately 60 metres. The gold mineralization observed at Rhosgobel is sheeted quartz veins hosted in a megacrystic quartz monzonite similar to the Blackjack deposit located 5 km to the north along the recently discovered Blackjack Mineralized Corridor. The first drill hole will be a step out to drill underneath the mineralized zone intersected in Holes 15 and 16 in shallow reverse circulation drilling (see Figure 4). This will be the first diamond drill hole ever drilled in the Rhosgobel intrusion. Geological interpretation of a steeply dipping mineralized zone is consistent with controls on mineralization observed elsewhere on the property.The Company has recently engaged GroundTruth Exploration to conduct grid based soil sampling in an area south of the Blackjack deposit where prospecting in 2015 identified a highly prospective area. The G2 zone was prospected in 2015 and 13 surface float samples were collected with a range of trace to 43.4 g/t gold (see Figure 5) within mineralized intrusive and metasedimentary rocks. Three other samples returned values of 5.9, 7.2 and 13.6 g/t gold . This area is located approximately 2 km south of the Blackjack gold deposit area, within the Blackjack Mineralized Corridor in proximity to the West Pukelman intrusion. Previous reconnaissance scale soil sampling encountered anomalous gold in soil in the area. The G2 zone is located approximately 1 km west of the Pukelman West intrusion within an extensional corridor containing both the Pukelman and Pukelman West intrusions and several previously reported lamprophyre dykes. The Pukelman West intrusion is located approximately 1.5 km south of the Blackjack deposit where recent drilling has intersected higher-grade mineralization associated with the N-S trending Blackjack fault. The intersection of these structural zones is interpreted by Sitka to be highly prospective for the discovery of additional gold mineralization.Prospecting in 2015 also focused on the Contact zone located at the southern margin of the Pukelman intrusion. Nineteen samples were collected ranging from trace to 166.2 g/t gold . Seven additional samples of mainly quartz vein material taken from float and outcrop assayed above 1.0 g/t gold including 86.0, 31.8, 47.2, 27.4, 18.1, 2.8, and 1.5 g/t gold (see Figure 5). The sampling indicates that the extent of the Contact zone could be much larger than the area previously drilled. Additional mapping and prospecting is planned to refine drill targets in anticipation of drilling this area.Geological mapping and prospecting in the G2 to Pukelman West corridor and along the Blackjack fault mineralized corridor from the Blackjack deposit south through the Pukelman West and Rhosgobel intrusion for additional areas of undiscovered gold mineralization will also be conducted with the goal of identifying additional drill targets.Recently acquired data encompassing the southern portion of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex is being integrated within the Sitka database and plans for drilling additional known areas of mineralization are being developed. Figure 1 - The acquisition of the Clear Creek property now completes Sitka Gold's 100% ownership of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex and adds several underexplored areas that have strong potential for new gold discoveries in addition to four high-quality drill targets. Figure 2 - The purchase of the Clear Creek Property (outlined in yellow boundary) now completes Sitka Gold's ownership of 100% of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex, an area of approximately 8 km x 15 km that includes several known surface intrusions with associated gold mineralization. The newly acquired property contains four highly prospective areas with limited historical drilling and several areas that have produced high-grade surface samples but remain under-explored and undrilled. Figure 3 - Shallow reverse circulation drilling in the Rhosgobel intrusion in 1995 produced numerous intersections of gold mineralization consisting of sheeted quartz veins with megacrystic quartz monzonite. Holes 15 and 16 were drilled in opposite directions at 60 degrees dip intersected mineralization over their entire lengths. The holes intersected 50.3 m grading 1.07 g/t gold and 67.1m of 1.03 g/t gold respectively with both holes ending in mineralization. Figure 4 - Cross-section of previous drilling at Rhosgobel along holes 15 and 16 which ended in mineralization. The first ever diamond drill hole proposed in the Rhosgobel intrusion (PROS-24-A) will step back and drill underneath holes 15 and 16 to test the width of the mineralized zone intersected in 1995. Figure 5 - Prospecting in 2015 was conducted in the G2 zone and the Contact Zone and produced many high-grade results. Additional grid soil sampling (shown in Figure 2) will be conducted in these areas and south where previous soil sampling has been conducted at only wide spacings. Current drilling is expanding the Blackjack deposit to the south towards this highly prospective area.

About the Flagship RC Gold Project The RC Gold Project consists of a 431 square kilometre contiguous district-scale land package located in the heart of Yukon's Tombstone Gold Belt. The project is located approximately 100 kilometres east of Dawson City, which has a 5,000 foot paved runway, and is accessed via a secondary gravel road from the Klondike Highway which is usable year-round and is an approximate 2 hour drive from Dawson City. It is the largest consolidated land package strategically positioned mid-way between Victoria Gold's Eagle Gold Mine - Yukon's newest gold mine which reached commercial production in the summer of 2020 - and Victoria Gold's former producing Brewery Creek Gold Mine.On January 19, 2023 Sitka Gold announced an Initial Mineral Resource Estimate prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\") guidelines for the RC Gold Property of 1,340,000 ounces of gold (1) . The road accessible, pit constrained Mineral Resource is classified as inferred and is contained in two zones: The Blackjack and Eiger deposits. Both of these deposits are at/near surface, are potentially open pit minable and amenable to heap leaching, with initial bottle roll tests indicating that the gold is not refractory and has high gold recoveries of up to 94% with minimal NaCN consumption (see News Release July 13, 2022). The Mineral Resource estimate is presented in the following table at a base case cut-off grade of 0.25 g/t Au: RC Gold Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate COG g/t Au Blackjack Zone Eiger Zone Combined Tonnes 000's Au g/t 0z Au 000's Tonnes 000's Au g/t 0z Au 000's Tonnes 000's Au g/t 0z Au 000's 0.2035,7980.80921 32,5230.45471 68,3210.631,391 0.25 33,743 0.83 900 27,362 0.50 440 61,105 0.68 1,340 0.3031,2820.88885 22,2530.55393 53,5350.741,2790.3529,0650.92860 17,8170.60344 46,8820.801,2030.4026,9750.96833 14,5060.66308 41,4810.861,140Notes Mineral resource estimate prepared by Ronald G. Simpson of GeoSim Services Inc. with an effective date of January 19, 2023. Mineral Resources are classified using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards. The cut-off grade of 0.25 g/t Au is believed to provide a reasonable margin over operating and sustaining costs for open-pit mining and processing Mineral resources are constrained by an optimised pit shell using the following assumptions: US $1800/oz Au price; a 45 degrees pit slope; assumed metallurgical recovery of 85%; mining costs of US$2.00 per tonne; processing costs of US$8.00 per tonne; G&A of US$1.50/t. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. Totals may not sum due to rounding. To date, 56 diamond drill holes have been drilled into this system for a total of approximately 19,962 metres including 16 drill holes totalling 6,515 metres completed in 2023 focused on expanding the initial resource. The drilling in 2023 produced results of up to 219.0 m of 1.34 g/t gold including 124.8 m of 2.01 g/t gold and 55.0 m of 3.11 g/t gold in drill hole DDRCCC-23-047 at Blackjack (see news release dated September 26, 2023). The Company is currently diamond drilling at RC Gold in conjunction with a planned 15,000 metre drilling program. Simpson, R. January 19, 2023. Clear Creek Property, RC Gold Project, NI 43-101 Technical Report, Dawson Mining District, Yukon Territory RC Gold Deposit Model Exploration on the Property has mainly focused on identifying an intrusion-related gold system (\"IRGS\"). The property is within the Tombstone Gold Belt which is the prominent host to IRGS deposits within the Tintina Gold Province in Yukon and Alaska. Notable deposits from the belt include: Fort Knox Mine in Alaska with current Proven and Probable Reserves of 230 million tonnes at 0.3 g/t Au (2.471 million ounces; Sims 2018) (1) ; Eagle Gold Mine with current Measured and Indicated Resources of 233 million tonnes at a grade of 0.57 g/t Au at the Eagle Main Zone (4.303 million ounces; Harvey et al, 2022) (2) ; the Brewery Creek deposit with current Indicated Mineral Resource of 22.2 million tonnes at a gold grade of 1.11 g/t (0.789 million ounces; Hulse et al. 2020) (3) ; the Florin Gold deposit, located adjacent to Sitka's RC Gold project, with a current Inferred Mineral Resource of 170.99 million tonnes grading 0.45 g/t (2.47 million ounces; Simpson 2021) (4) and the AurMac Project with an Inferred Mineral Resource of 347.49 million tonnes grading 0.63 gram per tonne gold (7.00 million ounces) (5) .

Grid geochemistry currently underway to infill gaps to the south of the Blackjack deposit on the high potential Pukelman West intrusion and G2 zone on the newly acquired Clear Creek claims. Integration of newly acquired datasets (geological, geophysical, geochemical) with Sitka Gold data. Geological mapping and prospecting following up on the high grade G2 zone, Contact zone and other highly prospective gold targets. VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / July 3, 2024 / Sitka Gold Corp. (\"Sitka\" or the \"Company\") (TSXV:SIG)(FSE:1RF)(OTCQB:SITKF) is pleased to announce that it has expanded the planned 2024 exploration program at its contiguous, 431 square kilometre RC Gold Project (\"RC Gold\" or the \"Project\") in Yukon to include diamond drilling and additional soil geochemistry surveys, geological mapping, prospecting and data integration and analysis on its newly acquired Clear Creek property (\"Clear Creek\") claims that complete the consolidation of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex (see Figure 1). The Company is currently diamond drilling at RC Gold in conjunction with a planned 15,000 metre drilling program for 2024. \"The accumulation of data from several years of systematic exploration by previous operators on the newly acquired Clear Creek Property has generated several high-quality exploration targets,\" said Cor Coe, Director and CEO of Sitka Gold. \"The newly acquired claims cover at least three intrusion related gold targets that are geologically similar to our developing Blackjack gold deposit and the team is very excited to begin assessing the property by testing the Rhosgobel intrusion, where historical work strongly indicates the potential for the presence of a multi-million ounce gold deposit. Sitka's initial discovery of the Blackjack and Eiger gold deposits came about through a similar process of review and compilation of a large historical database and we see the ability to accelerate the discovery of additional gold deposits by utilizing our growing knowledge of the intrusion-related gold systems in this area in conjunction with the comprehensive Clear Creek data-set as we continue our exploration activities across this emerging mining district.\" Story continues The newly consolidated Project includes four high-priority areas that have had previous reverse circulation and/or diamond drilling that require additional drilling. These areas are the Rhosgobel intrusion where historical drilling intersected up to 1.03 g/t gold over 67.1 m , the Contact zone with drill results up to 20.3 g/t gold over 10.7 m , the Bear Paw Breccia which intersected up to 1.87 g/t gold over 42.6 m and the Pukelman intrusion with results of 1.20 g/t gold over 10.0 m (see Figure 2, Table 1). The first target area to be tested is the Rhosgobel Intrusion where shallow historical drilling in 1995 by Kennecott outlined a large area of intrusion related gold mineralization (see Figure 3). Previous drilling at Rhosgobel was limited to a vertical depth of approximately 60 metres. The gold mineralization observed at Rhosgobel is sheeted quartz veins hosted in a megacrystic quartz monzonite similar to the Blackjack deposit located 5 km to the north along the recently discovered Blackjack Mineralized Corridor. The first drill hole will be a step out to drill underneath the mineralized zone intersected in Holes 15 and 16 in shallow reverse circulation drilling (see Figure 4). This will be the first diamond drill hole ever drilled in the Rhosgobel intrusion. Geological interpretation of a steeply dipping mineralized zone is consistent with controls on mineralization observed elsewhere on the property.The Company has recently engaged GroundTruth Exploration to conduct grid based soil sampling in an area south of the Blackjack deposit where prospecting in 2015 identified a highly prospective area. The G2 zone was prospected in 2015 and 13 surface float samples were collected with a range of trace to 43.4 g/t gold (see Figure 5) within mineralized intrusive and metasedimentary rocks. Three other samples returned values of 5.9, 7.2 and 13.6 g/t gold . This area is located approximately 2 km south of the Blackjack gold deposit area, within the Blackjack Mineralized Corridor in proximity to the West Pukelman intrusion. Previous reconnaissance scale soil sampling encountered anomalous gold in soil in the area. The G2 zone is located approximately 1 km west of the Pukelman West intrusion within an extensional corridor containing both the Pukelman and Pukelman West intrusions and several previously reported lamprophyre dykes. The Pukelman West intrusion is located approximately 1.5 km south of the Blackjack deposit where recent drilling has intersected higher-grade mineralization associated with the N-S trending Blackjack fault. The intersection of these structural zones is interpreted by Sitka to be highly prospective for the discovery of additional gold mineralization.Prospecting in 2015 also focused on the Contact zone located at the southern margin of the Pukelman intrusion. Nineteen samples were collected ranging from trace to 166.2 g/t gold . Seven additional samples of mainly quartz vein material taken from float and outcrop assayed above 1.0 g/t gold including 86.0, 31.8, 47.2, 27.4, 18.1, 2.8, and 1.5 g/t gold (see Figure 5). The sampling indicates that the extent of the Contact zone could be much larger than the area previously drilled. Additional mapping and prospecting is planned to refine drill targets in anticipation of drilling this area.Geological mapping and prospecting in the G2 to Pukelman West corridor and along the Blackjack fault mineralized corridor from the Blackjack deposit south through the Pukelman West and Rhosgobel intrusion for additional areas of undiscovered gold mineralization will also be conducted with the goal of identifying additional drill targets.Recently acquired data encompassing the southern portion of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex is being integrated within the Sitka database and plans for drilling additional known areas of mineralization are being developed. Figure 1 - The acquisition of the Clear Creek property now completes Sitka Gold's 100% ownership of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex and adds several underexplored areas that have strong potential for new gold discoveries in addition to four high-quality drill targets. Figure 2 - The purchase of the Clear Creek Property (outlined in yellow boundary) now completes Sitka Gold's ownership of 100% of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex, an area of approximately 8 km x 15 km that includes several known surface intrusions with associated gold mineralization. The newly acquired property contains four highly prospective areas with limited historical drilling and several areas that have produced high-grade surface samples but remain under-explored and undrilled. Figure 3 - Shallow reverse circulation drilling in the Rhosgobel intrusion in 1995 produced numerous intersections of gold mineralization consisting of sheeted quartz veins with megacrystic quartz monzonite. Holes 15 and 16 were drilled in opposite directions at 60 degrees dip intersected mineralization over their entire lengths. The holes intersected 50.3 m grading 1.07 g/t gold and 67.1m of 1.03 g/t gold respectively with both holes ending in mineralization. Figure 4 - Cross-section of previous drilling at Rhosgobel along holes 15 and 16 which ended in mineralization. The first ever diamond drill hole proposed in the Rhosgobel intrusion (PROS-24-A) will step back and drill underneath holes 15 and 16 to test the width of the mineralized zone intersected in 1995. Figure 5 - Prospecting in 2015 was conducted in the G2 zone and the Contact Zone and produced many high-grade results. Additional grid soil sampling (shown in Figure 2) will be conducted in these areas and south where previous soil sampling has been conducted at only wide spacings. Current drilling is expanding the Blackjack deposit to the south towards this highly prospective area.

About the Flagship RC Gold Project The RC Gold Project consists of a 431 square kilometre contiguous district-scale land package located in the heart of Yukon's Tombstone Gold Belt. The project is located approximately 100 kilometres east of Dawson City, which has a 5,000 foot paved runway, and is accessed via a secondary gravel road from the Klondike Highway which is usable year-round and is an approximate 2 hour drive from Dawson City. It is the largest consolidated land package strategically positioned mid-way between Victoria Gold's Eagle Gold Mine - Yukon's newest gold mine which reached commercial production in the summer of 2020 - and Victoria Gold's former producing Brewery Creek Gold Mine.On January 19, 2023 Sitka Gold announced an Initial Mineral Resource Estimate prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\") guidelines for the RC Gold Property of 1,340,000 ounces of gold (1) . The road accessible, pit constrained Mineral Resource is classified as inferred and is contained in two zones: The Blackjack and Eiger deposits. Both of these deposits are at/near surface, are potentially open pit minable and amenable to heap leaching, with initial bottle roll tests indicating that the gold is not refractory and has high gold recoveries of up to 94% with minimal NaCN consumption (see News Release July 13, 2022). The Mineral Resource estimate is presented in the following table at a base case cut-off grade of 0.25 g/t Au: RC Gold Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate COG g/t Au Blackjack Zone Eiger Zone Combined Tonnes 000's Au g/t 0z Au 000's Tonnes 000's Au g/t 0z Au 000's Tonnes 000's Au g/t 0z Au 000's 0.2035,7980.8092132,5230.4547168,3210.631,391 0.25 33,743 0.83 900 27,362 0.50 440 61,105 0.68 1,340 0.3031,2820.8888522,2530.5539353,5350.741,2790.3529,0650.9286017,8170.6034446,8820.801,2030.4026,9750.9683314,5060.6630841,4810.861,140 Notes Mineral resource estimate prepared by Ronald G. Simpson of GeoSim Services Inc. with an effective date of January 19, 2023. Mineral Resources are classified using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards. The cut-off grade of 0.25 g/t Au is believed to provide a reasonable margin over operating and sustaining costs for open-pit mining and processing Mineral resources are constrained by an optimised pit shell using the following assumptions: US$1800/oz Au price; a 45 degrees pit slope; assumed metallurgical recovery of 85%; mining costs of US$2.00 per tonne; processing costs of US$8.00 per tonne; G&A of US$1.50/t. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. Totals may not sum due to rounding. To date, 56 diamond drill holes have been drilled into this system for a total of approximately 19,962 metres including 16 drill holes totalling 6,515 metres completed in 2023 focused on expanding the initial resource. The drilling in 2023 produced results of up to 219.0 m of 1.34 g/t gold including 124.8 m of 2.01 g/t gold and 55.0 m of 3.11 g/t gold in drill hole DDRCCC-23-047 at Blackjack (see news release dated September 26, 2023). The Company is currently diamond drilling at RC Gold in conjunction with a planned 15,000 metre drilling program. Simpson, R. January 19, 2023. Clear Creek Property, RC Gold Project, NI 43-101 Technical Report, Dawson Mining District, Yukon Territory RC Gold Deposit Model Exploration on the Property has mainly focused on identifying an intrusion-related gold system (\"IRGS\").

    "Content": "US natural gas prices fall - Markets - Business Recorder Markets Print 2024-07-04 US natural gas prices fall Reuters Published July 4, 2024 Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Comments Follow us NEW YORK: US natural gas futures held near a seven-week low on Wednesday as the market waits for direction from what should be a bullish federal report expected to show last week's storage build was smaller than usual for an eighth week in a row. That lack of price movement came despite a bullish heat wave expected to linger over much of the country through at least mid-July and a bearish rise in output so far in July versus June and the tremendous oversupply of gas still in storage. The heat wave should prompt power generators to continue burning lots of gas to produce electricity to keep air conditioners humming. Traders said recent storage builds have been smaller than usual because several producers cut output earlier in the year after futures prices dropped to 3-1/2-year lows in February and March. Higher prices in recent weeks, however, prompted some producers, including EQT and Chesapeake Energy, to return to the well pad. Analysts forecast US utilities added 32 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas into storage during the week ended June 28. That compares with an increase of 76 bcf in the same week last year and a five-year (2019-2023) average rise of 69 bcf for this time of year. If correct, that will leave about 19% more gas in storage than normal at this time of year. Front-month gas futures for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 0.8 cents, or 0.3%, to $2.443 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 8:45 a.m. EDT (1245 GMT). On Tuesday, the contract closed at its lowest since May 15 for a second day in a row. Recent declines in the front-month caused futures for September, which usually trade at a discount to August, to jump to a record premium of around 2.9 cents per mmBtu over the August contract. In the spot market, next-day gas prices at the Waha hub in West Texas plunged from a negative 52 cents per mmBtu for Tuesday to negative $2.06 for Wednesday as pipeline constraints trapped gas in the Permian Shale. It was the fourth time in seven days that Waha prices fell into negative territory during the current heat wave and the 21st time so far this year. Next-day Waha prices first averaged below zero in 2019. It happened 17 times in 2019, six in 2020, none in 2021 or 2022, and once in 2023. Financial firm LSEG said gas output in the Lower 48 US states rose to an average of 101.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in July. US natural gas Comments Comments are closed.

Expand Here's the latest: August Nymex natural gas futures down 12.3 cents to $2.478/MMBtu as of 2:40 p.m. ET Lower 48 gas production rose to 102 Bcf/d on Sunday, the highest level since March 11, Wood Mackenzie data show Category 4 Hurricane Beryl is tracking to cross Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, potentially avoiding a direct strike on the Lower 48 The August contract started to trade below $2.500/MMBtu before 11 a.m. ET before bouncing on either side of the closely watched level into midday. \"Critical support sits at $2.50,\" EBW Analytics Group analyst Eli Rubin said. Forecasting from DTN shed 6.5 cooling degree days (CDD) from its Lower 48 forecasts over the next three weeks since Friday, equating to 10.4 Bcf lower demand, Rubin said. Maxar's Weather Desk also pointed to cooler temperatures. However, NatGasWeather painted a more mixed picture with weekend updates both shedding and adding modest amounts of CDD in the American and European weather models. Both forecasts continued to point to the hottest first half of July of the past 50 years, however, both models have tended to overestimate summer's heat \"and the expectation is they are doing so again this summer,\" NatGasWeather said. Wood Mackenzie estimated Lower 48 gas production fell to 100.0 Bcf/d on Monday, but analysts expected that number to be revised higher in later cycles because of volatility at the start of the month. Freeport LNG terminal's Train 2 was down about 15 hours from Saturday to Sunday, but flows have bounced back on Monday Cheniere Energy Inc.'s Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas export facility may have completed a round of maintenance U.S. LNG feed gas demand climbed to about 12.9 Bcf/d for Monday, highest since last Sunday, according to NGI's U.S. LNG Export Tracker Freeport staff told Texas officials that the facility's Train 2 tripped because of compressor issues. Feed gas flows fell to about 1.6 Bcf/d Saturday and 1.3 Bcf/d Sunday, NGI data show. On Monday, service regained its earlier June pace with nominations at around 1.9 Bcf/d. Kpler has a ship in berth loading and more scheduled through the week. Meanwhile, an uptick in feed gas flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend hints at the terminal wrapping up its traditional June maintenance. Flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend topped out above 4.3 Bcf on Sunday and were scheduled to be around 4.2 Bcf on Monday, NGI data show. \"The terminal could likely run a bit higher, with optimal summer flows near 4.4 Bcf/d,\" Criterion Research Inc.'s James Bevan, vice president of Research, said on online energy platform Enelyst. Elsewhere, flows to Cheniere's Corpus Christi and Sempra Infrastructure's Cameron LNG terminals were stable at about 2.3 Bcf/d and 1.9 Bcf/d, respectively, NGI data show. NGI modeling 29 Bcf injection into Lower 48 storage for week ending June 28 A print in-line with NGI's estimate for this week's U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report would further eat into the Lower 48's lofty storage surplus. Last week's report showed working gas in underground storage stood at 528 Bcf, or a nearly 21% surplus to the five-year average. All but eight of the last 10 weekly injections have lagged the five-year average, narrowing the surplus from 37% in mid-April. For the week ending June 28, the five-year average is an injection of 69 Bcf, while the year-earlier period saw an 76 Bcf increase. Henry Hub spot prices lower at $2.205, down 18.5 cents, NGI's MidDay Price Alert data show Southeast weaker on cooler forecasts, West Texas prices stay negative Waha rose 8.5 cents to negative $2.035 on Monday, according to NGI's MidDay Price Alert. Transco Zone 5 in the Southeast shed 25.5 cents to average $2.560, as forecasts for the region turned cooler. Weather model runs on Monday pulled Southeast forecasts for the next 10 days below normal while the 11- to 15-day outlook is only now marginally above normal, Bevan said. The cooler look resulted in a demand loss of around 9 Bcf for the region, stacking onto losses from Thursday and Friday, Bevan said. Also likely impacting prices in the Southeast is supply from the Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC (MVP), which officially began firm transport service on Monday. The new pipeline is scheduled to deliver its highest volume yet to the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Co. (aka Transco) on Monday at around 0.97 Bcf/d, or nearly half its capacity, according to Wood Mackenzie flow data. Transco's Station 160 in North Carolina, which is south of the mainline's interconnect with MVP, showed southbound flows into the Southeast rose above 2 Bcf/d Monday, setting a new high for 2024, Bevan said.

Here are the instructions how to enable JavaScript in your web browser. Skip to main content Advertisement Home Special reports 02 Jul 24 Rystad Energy: Bullish market fundamentals are the main contributing factor to higher global oil prices Advertisement Here is Rystad Energy's oil macro update from Global Market Analysis Director Claudio Galimberti: \"Strong market fundamentals are pushing oil prices higher this week, on track for four consecutive weeks of increases. Lower crude exports from OPEC and Russia, just as refinery runs ramp up for the summer peak, are helping contribute to a tighter-than-expected market, and prices are reacting accordingly. Increasingly likely interest rates cuts by the Fed in coming months and still high geopolitical risk premium are adding to the upward pressure.\" Better-than-expected market fundamentals and expectations of forthcoming interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve are helping keep oil prices on a bullish trajectory this week.Rystad Energy modelling suggests most of the price increases have been driven by bullish fundamentals, specifically on the refining and crude side, while macroeconomic factors and ongoing concerns regarding the escalation of conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine have played a secondary, albeit non-negligible, role.Brent prices increased by more than 6% in June, and July is starting on a similar path.Looking at the fundamentals, we have significantly lowered our forecast for US oil production from August onwards.These adjustments reflect a downturn in Permian oil output due to ongoing low activity and consolidation through mergers and acquisitions.Most changes are concentrated on the Texas side, while New Mexico has shown resilience, although April data reflects a decline in monthly figures, averaging a fall of approximately 80 000 bpd. Overall, the downward adjustment from August 2024 through December 2025 averages about 200 000 bpd.These adjustments are bullish for Brent prices and support a narrowing of the WTI-Brent spread.It should help provide some relief for OPEC+, given the production cuts they have implemented and the planned unwinding of the voluntary reductions starting in October, for the following 12 months.Recent reports suggest OPEC+ crude exports declined in June versus May, but the latest official data showed steady exports from the Middle East and declining exports from Russia in May.If crude exports from OPEC - after accounting for changes in crude burns and refinery runs - are confirmed to have declined by somewhere between 3% and 4% in June, then that may point to greater compliance by OPEC members. However, that is still speculative.Russia's seaborne crude flows in the week to 23 June appear to have dropped by 0.66 million bpd, to the lowest in more than three months.The combined effect of lower crude exports from OPEC and Russia, right at the time when global refinery runs are expected to further rump up - from 83.1 million bpd in June to 84.4 in August - would explain the tighter crude market and the surge in Brent prices over the past three weeks.On macroeconomics, the latest data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) showed that US inflation, measured by the personal consumption expenditures (CPE) index, eased further to 2.6% year on year in May, matching expectations. The core PCE, excluding food and fuel prices, also decreased to 2.6%, the lowest since March 2021.These figures are pivotal for the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate-setting decision on 31 July, with markets anticipating at least two quarter-point rate cuts this year, potentially starting in September. Despite the encouraging inflation data, a September cut remains uncertain as the pace of decline remains slow, which may be perceived as too gradual. On the political front, the US Presidential debate on Thursday night has dominated the airwaves.Early policy indications suggest either candidate would favour protectionist measures and large budget deficits if elected.This isn't good news for inflation, as both stances are inflationary.Energy-specific messaging was hard to identify in the debate, but it's safe to assume that a Trump administration would be pro-deregulation while Biden would continue to push policies aimed at advancing the green transition. In Europe, French President Emmanuel Macron's decision to call snap elections for the National Assembly backfired on Sunday as the National Rally party won by a significant margin in the first round of voting. Macron took a huge risk, but with the second round of voting this coming weekend, the exact fallout is still unclear.The second round of voting on 7 July will be pivotal for France's political stability and its leadership within the EU and the transatlantic community during this critical period.

Expand Here's the latest: August Nymex natural gas futures down 12.3 cents to $2.478/MMBtu as of 2:40 p.m. ET Lower 48 gas production rose to 102 Bcf/d on Sunday, the highest level since March 11, Wood Mackenzie data show Category 4 Hurricane Beryl is tracking to cross Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, potentially avoiding a direct strike on the Lower 48 The August contract started to trade below $2.500/MMBtu before 11 a.m. ET before bouncing on either side of the closely watched level into midday. \"Critical support sits at $2.50,\" EBW Analytics Group analyst Eli Rubin said. Forecasting from DTN shed 6.5 cooling degree days (CDD) from its Lower 48 forecasts over the next three weeks since Friday, equating to 10.4 Bcf lower demand, Rubin said. Maxar's Weather Desk also pointed to cooler temperatures. However, NatGasWeather painted a more mixed picture with weekend updates both shedding and adding modest amounts of CDD in the American and European weather models. Both forecasts continued to point to the hottest first half of July of the past 50 years, however, both models have tended to overestimate summer's heat \"and the expectation is they are doing so again this summer,\" NatGasWeather said. Wood Mackenzie estimated Lower 48 gas production fell to 100.0 Bcf/d on Monday, but analysts expected that number to be revised higher in later cycles because of volatility at the start of the month. Freeport LNG terminal's Train 2 was down about 15 hours from Saturday to Sunday, but flows have bounced back on Monday Cheniere Energy Inc.'s Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas export facility may have completed a round of maintenance U.S. LNG feed gas demand climbed to about 12.9 Bcf/d for Monday, highest since last Sunday, according to NGI's U.S. LNG Export Tracker Freeport staff told Texas officials that the facility's Train 2 tripped because of compressor issues. Feed gas flows fell to about 1.6 Bcf/d Saturday and 1.3 Bcf/d Sunday, NGI data show. On Monday, service regained its earlier June pace with nominations at around 1.9 Bcf/d. Kpler has a ship in berth loading and more scheduled through the week. Meanwhile, an uptick in feed gas flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend hints at the terminal wrapping up its traditional June maintenance. Flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend topped out above 4.3 Bcf on Sunday and were scheduled to be around 4.2 Bcf on Monday, NGI data show. \"The terminal could likely run a bit higher, with optimal summer flows near 4.4 Bcf/d,\" Criterion Research Inc.'s James Bevan, vice president of Research, said on online energy platform Enelyst. Elsewhere, flows to Cheniere's Corpus Christi and Sempra Infrastructure's Cameron LNG terminals were stable at about 2.3 Bcf/d and 1.9 Bcf/d, respectively, NGI data show. NGI modeling 29 Bcf injection into Lower 48 storage for week ending June 28 A print in-line with NGI's estimate for this week's U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report would further eat into the Lower 48's lofty storage surplus. Last week's report showed working gas in underground storage stood at 528 Bcf, or a nearly 21% surplus to the five-year average. All but eight of the last 10 weekly injections have lagged the five-year average, narrowing the surplus from 37% in mid-April. For the week ending June 28, the five-year average is an injection of 69 Bcf, while the year-earlier period saw an 76 Bcf increase. Henry Hub spot prices lower at $2.205, down 18.5 cents, NGI's MidDay Price Alert data show Southeast weaker on cooler forecasts, West Texas prices stay negative Waha rose 8.5 cents to negative $2.035 on Monday, according to NGI's MidDay Price Alert. Transco Zone 5 in the Southeast shed 25.5 cents to average $2.560, as forecasts for the region turned cooler. Weather model runs on Monday pulled Southeast forecasts for the next 10 days below normal while the 11- to 15-day outlook is only now marginally above normal, Bevan said. The cooler look resulted in a demand loss of around 9 Bcf for the region, stacking onto losses from Thursday and Friday, Bevan said. Also likely impacting prices in the Southeast is supply from the Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC (MVP), which officially began firm transport service on Monday. The new pipeline is scheduled to deliver its highest volume yet to the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Co. (aka Transco) on Monday at around 0.97 Bcf/d, or nearly half its capacity, according to Wood Mackenzie flow data. Transco's Station 160 in North Carolina, which is south of the mainline's interconnect with MVP, showed southbound flows into the Southeast rose above 2 Bcf/d Monday, setting a new high for 2024, Bevan said.

Front-month gas futures for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 2.4 cents, or 1.0%, to $2.454 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 8:49 a.m. EDT (1249 GMT), putting the contract on track for its lowest close since May 15 for a second day in a row.In other news, a federal judge dealt US President Joe Biden's climate agenda a setback by blocking the Democrat's administration from continuing to pause the approval of applications to export liquefied natural gas (LNG). In Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), power grid operator for most of the state, said peak demand this week will come close to but not break the record for the month of July as homes and businesses crank up their air conditioners to escape a heat wave.In the spot market, next-day gas prices at the Waha hub in West Texas plunged by about 123% to a negative 52 cents per mmBtu for Tuesday as pipeline constraints trap gas in the Permian Shale again.That is the third time in six days Waha prices fell into negative territory during the current heat wave and the 20th time so far this year. Next-day Waha prices first averaged below zero in 2019. It happened 17 times in 2019, six in 2020, none in 2021 and 2022, and once in 2023.In the Caribbean Sea, Hurricane Beryl, an extremely dangerous major hurricane, will hit Jamaica on Wednesday before slamming slam into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the latest US National Hurricane Center (NHC) outlook.

Analysts forecast there was still about 19% more gas in storage than usual for this time of year even though output reductions earlier in 2024 kept weekly injections below normal over the past seven weeks.That price decline came even though the heat wave blanketing much of the country for weeks will linger through at least mid-July, forcing power generators to continue burning lots of gas to keep air conditioners humming. Front-month gas futures for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 6.5 cents, or 2.5%, to $2.536 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 10:17 a.m. EDT (1417 GMT), putting the contract on track for its lowest close since May 29.Even though gas prices gained about 4% last week, speculators cut their net long futures and options positions on the New York Mercantile and Intercontinental Exchanges for the first time in three weeks, according to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Commitments of Traders report.In Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the power grid operator for most of the state, said peak demand came close but did not break the record for the month of June last week, as had been expected.ERCOT, however, projects demand will break the July record on Tuesday as homes and businesses crank up their air conditioners to escape the heat blanketing the state.

Skip to main content Advertisement Home Business news 02 Jul 24 Rystad Energy: Bullish market fundamentals are the main contributing factor to higher global oil prices Advertisement Here is Rystad Energy's oil macro update from Global Market Analysis Director Claudio Galimberti: \"Strong market fundamentals are pushing oil prices higher this week, on track for four consecutive weeks of increases. Lower crude exports from OPEC and Russia, just as refinery runs ramp up for the summer peak, are helping contribute to a tighter-than-expected market, and prices are reacting accordingly. Increasingly likely interest rates cuts by the Fed in coming months and still high geopolitical risk premium are adding to the upward pressure.\" Better-than-expected market fundamentals and expectations of forthcoming interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve are helping keep oil prices on a bullish trajectory this week.Rystad Energy modelling suggests most of the price increases have been driven by bullish fundamentals, specifically on the refining and crude side, while macroeconomic factors and ongoing concerns regarding the escalation of conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine have played a secondary, albeit non-negligible, role.Brent prices increased by more than 6% in June, and July is starting on a similar path.Looking at the fundamentals, we have significantly lowered our forecast for US oil production from August onwards.These adjustments reflect a downturn in Permian oil output due to ongoing low activity and consolidation through mergers and acquisitions.Most changes are concentrated on the Texas side, while New Mexico has shown resilience, although April data reflects a decline in monthly figures, averaging a fall of approximately 80 000 bpd. Overall, the downward adjustment from August 2024 through December 2025 averages about 200 000 bpd.These adjustments are bullish for Brent prices and support a narrowing of the WTI-Brent spread.It should help provide some relief for OPEC+, given the production cuts they have implemented and the planned unwinding of the voluntary reductions starting in October, for the following 12 months.Recent reports suggest OPEC+ crude exports declined in June versus May, but the latest official data showed steady exports from the Middle East and declining exports from Russia in May.If crude exports from OPEC - after accounting for changes in crude burns and refinery runs - are confirmed to have declined by somewhere between 3% and 4% in June, then that may point to greater compliance by OPEC members. However, that is still speculative.Russia's seaborne crude flows in the week to 23 June appear to have dropped by 0.66 million bpd, to the lowest in more than three months.The combined effect of lower crude exports from OPEC and Russia, right at the time when global refinery runs are expected to further rump up - from 83.1 million bpd in June to 84.4 in August - would explain the tighter crude market and the surge in Brent prices over the past three weeks.On macroeconomics, the latest data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) showed that US inflation, measured by the personal consumption expenditures (CPE) index, eased further to 2.6% year on year in May, matching expectations. The core PCE, excluding food and fuel prices, also decreased to 2.6%, the lowest since March 2021.These figures are pivotal for the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate-setting decision on 31 July, with markets anticipating at least two quarter-point rate cuts this year, potentially starting in September. Despite the encouraging inflation data, a September cut remains uncertain as the pace of decline remains slow, which may be perceived as too gradual. On the political front, the US Presidential debate on Thursday night has dominated the airwaves.Early policy indications suggest either candidate would favour protectionist measures and large budget deficits if elected.This isn't good news for inflation, as both stances are inflationary.Energy-specific messaging was hard to identify in the debate, but it's safe to assume that a Trump administration would be pro-deregulation while Biden would continue to push policies aimed at advancing the green transition. In Europe, French President Emmanuel Macron's decision to call snap elections for the National Assembly backfired on Sunday as the National Rally party won by a significant margin in the first round of voting. Macron took a huge risk, but with the second round of voting this coming weekend, the exact fallout is still unclear.The second round of voting on 7 July will be pivotal for France's political stability and its leadership within the EU and the transatlantic community during this critical period.

    "Content": "Dangote Refinery: Crude oil supply options - Blueprint Newspapers Limited Skip to content The international corporations drilling oil in Nigeria are the country's greatest enemies. They have never hidden their condescension for Nigeria even as they are allowed to operate the industry on their own terms. In fact, the IOCs are partially responsible for Nigeria's total dependence on imported refined petroleum products.The international oil companies (IOCs) are compelled to operate refineries in most of the countries they drill oil. In Nigeria they defiantly snubbed the federal government's directives that they should establish refineries. Their excuse was that no refinery could succeed in Nigeria because the federal government stands around to fix unacceptable pump prices for refined petroleum products.Aliko Dangote, president of the Dangote Group, and some development banks in the international money market came together to prove that the treacherous oil firms exploiting crude oil in Nigeria were telling transparent lies when they refused to establish refineries in Nigeria on the grounds that the pump prices of refined petroleum products were controlled by the federal government. The international money market advanced loans close to $9 billion to Dangote for the establishment of what is now acknowledged as one of the world's largest refineries.No one would advance such a colossal sum as a loan for a venture known to have no means of repaying the loan. The fact that the international development banks were willing to fund Dangote Refinery is a clear indication that the venture was viable and could not be bugged down by government regulation of the pump prices of refined petroleum products.The lies of the IOCs were exposed by the success in sourcing for funds to build a giant refinery in Nigeria.The mischievous oil firms were disgraced as their lies were exposed. They gnashed their teeth and proceeded to wait for Dangote and the Nigerian people down the road.The refinery they were determined to truncate came on stream in January 2024 and in apparent frustration they drew up fresh plans to sabotage the business of the refinery and keep Nigeria as a perpetual importer of refined petroleum products.They know that if Dangote Refinery succeeds, the refineries in Europe that were supplying refined petroleum products to Nigeria at a catastrophic cost of well over $20 billion annually could be out of businessThey decided to use the last weapon in their armoury to frustrate Dangote Refinery. They defiantly refused to sell crude oil to Dangote. Those who reluctantly offer to sell the feedstock put their price tag at $6 above what obtains in the international market.Consequently, Dangote has been compelled to import crude oil for his refinery from the United States of America (USA) when Nigeria remains the highest producer of crude oil in Africa.The treacherous international oil companies operating in Nigeria have finally held Dangote Refinery and the Nigerian people in the jugular.Diesel from Dangote Refinery is more expensive than the high sulfur diesels imported by independent petroleum marketers from Europe into Nigeria.The most painful aspect of the sabotage by the IOCs is that the regulator of the industry sees nothing wrong with collaborating with foreigners to frustrate a Nigerian venture designed to ease the merciless grip of European petroleum refiners on Nigerians.The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) apathetically issues licences to independent petroleum marketers to import diesel from Europe with a weak naira and torment Nigerian consumers with high energy cost that escalates the country's catastrophic inflationary trend.When newsmen confronted the agency on the illogicality of encouraging diesel imports when a Nigerian refinery is ready to supply, NMDPRA retorted that in a deregulated market, marketers are free to source diesel from anywhere.NMDPRA is the regulatory arm of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL). The company is more or less an appendage of the mischievous international oil companies battling to protect the interest of European crude oil refiners patronised by NNPCL.NNPCL, as industry regulator, could order the deceitful IOCs to sell crude oil to Dangote Refinery at international market price. But it could only do so to the detriment of its own selfish interest.NNPCL would lose trillions of naira if Dangote Refinery gets crude oil from Nigeria and sells refined petroleum products locally at reduced pump prices.That would mean the end of the petrol subsidy scandal through which the company rakes in trillions of naira annually. That explains why NNPCL allows foreign exploiters to frustrate Dangote Refinery.NNPCL has unrestrained powers to supply crude oil to Dangote Refinery which at the moment is the only way to ease the asphyxiating hold of high energy cost on Nigeria's economy.If the treacherous IOCs defy NNPCL's directive to supply crude oil to Dangote Refinery at international market rate, the company could do the job by itself.NNPCL allocates 445,000 barrels of crude oil daily to Nigeria's moribund refineries. Nigeria's four refineries have not refined a barrel of crude oil in the last three years.Consequently, NNPCL exports the 445,000 barrels of crude oil daily to foreign refineries that feed Nigeria with refined petroleum products in return. If NNPCL reroutes the crude oil to Dangote Refinery, Nigeria would benefit extensively.The foreign refineries use the residue of the crude oil supplied by NNPCL for their petrochemical products and export them to Nigeria. If Dangote Refinery gets the crude oil, the residue would be used to produce resins that would be used to ease the escalating cost of producing plastic containers in the soft drink and brewery industries.Besides, NNPCL owes Dangote Refinery the sum of $1.7 billion as part of the 20 per cent equity it bought. It was expected to pay back with 300,000 barrels of crude oil daily. Its refusal to supply borders on betrayal of trust.It is rather saddening that Mele Kyari, the man who navigated NNPCL through the horrendous petrol subsidy scandal and crude oil theft, is still its group managing director. The man should do the right thing.

Expand Here's the latest: August Nymex natural gas futures down 12.3 cents to $2.478/MMBtu as of 2:40 p.m. ET Lower 48 gas production rose to 102 Bcf/d on Sunday, the highest level since March 11, Wood Mackenzie data show Category 4 Hurricane Beryl is tracking to cross Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, potentially avoiding a direct strike on the Lower 48 The August contract started to trade below $2.500/MMBtu before 11 a.m. ET before bouncing on either side of the closely watched level into midday. \"Critical support sits at $2.50,\" EBW Analytics Group analyst Eli Rubin said. Forecasting from DTN shed 6.5 cooling degree days (CDD) from its Lower 48 forecasts over the next three weeks since Friday, equating to 10.4 Bcf lower demand, Rubin said. Maxar's Weather Desk also pointed to cooler temperatures. However, NatGasWeather painted a more mixed picture with weekend updates both shedding and adding modest amounts of CDD in the American and European weather models. Both forecasts continued to point to the hottest first half of July of the past 50 years, however, both models have tended to overestimate summer's heat \"and the expectation is they are doing so again this summer,\" NatGasWeather said. Wood Mackenzie estimated Lower 48 gas production fell to 100.0 Bcf/d on Monday, but analysts expected that number to be revised higher in later cycles because of volatility at the start of the month. Freeport LNG terminal's Train 2 was down about 15 hours from Saturday to Sunday, but flows have bounced back on Monday Cheniere Energy Inc.'s Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas export facility may have completed a round of maintenance U.S. LNG feed gas demand climbed to about 12.9 Bcf/d for Monday, highest since last Sunday, according to NGI's U.S. LNG Export Tracker Freeport staff told Texas officials that the facility's Train 2 tripped because of compressor issues. Feed gas flows fell to about 1.6 Bcf/d Saturday and 1.3 Bcf/d Sunday, NGI data show. On Monday, service regained its earlier June pace with nominations at around 1.9 Bcf/d. Kpler has a ship in berth loading and more scheduled through the week. Meanwhile, an uptick in feed gas flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend hints at the terminal wrapping up its traditional June maintenance. Flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend topped out above 4.3 Bcf on Sunday and were scheduled to be around 4.2 Bcf on Monday, NGI data show. \"The terminal could likely run a bit higher, with optimal summer flows near 4.4 Bcf/d,\" Criterion Research Inc.'s James Bevan, vice president of Research, said on online energy platform Enelyst. Elsewhere, flows to Cheniere's Corpus Christi and Sempra Infrastructure's Cameron LNG terminals were stable at about 2.3 Bcf/d and 1.9 Bcf/d, respectively, NGI data show. NGI modeling 29 Bcf injection into Lower 48 storage for week ending June 28 A print in-line with NGI's estimate for this week's U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report would further eat into the Lower 48's lofty storage surplus. Last week's report showed working gas in underground storage stood at 528 Bcf, or a nearly 21% surplus to the five-year average. All but eight of the last 10 weekly injections have lagged the five-year average, narrowing the surplus from 37% in mid-April. For the week ending June 28, the five-year average is an injection of 69 Bcf, while the year-earlier period saw an 76 Bcf increase. Henry Hub spot prices lower at $2.205, down 18.5 cents, NGI's MidDay Price Alert data show Southeast weaker on cooler forecasts, West Texas prices stay negative Waha rose 8.5 cents to negative $2.035 on Monday, according to NGI's MidDay Price Alert. Transco Zone 5 in the Southeast shed 25.5 cents to average $2.560, as forecasts for the region turned cooler. Weather model runs on Monday pulled Southeast forecasts for the next 10 days below normal while the 11- to 15-day outlook is only now marginally above normal, Bevan said. The cooler look resulted in a demand loss of around 9 Bcf for the region, stacking onto losses from Thursday and Friday, Bevan said. Also likely impacting prices in the Southeast is supply from the Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC (MVP), which officially began firm transport service on Monday. The new pipeline is scheduled to deliver its highest volume yet to the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Co. (aka Transco) on Monday at around 0.97 Bcf/d, or nearly half its capacity, according to Wood Mackenzie flow data. Transco's Station 160 in North Carolina, which is south of the mainline's interconnect with MVP, showed southbound flows into the Southeast rose above 2 Bcf/d Monday, setting a new high for 2024, Bevan said.

    "Content": "US natgas prices ease to 6-week low on rising output, lower LNG feedgas US natgas prices ease to 6-week low on rising output, lower LNG feedgas July 2 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures eased about 1% to a six-week low on rising output, forecasts for less demand over the next two weeks than previously expected due to lower liquefied natural gas (LNG) feedgas and an ongoing oversupply of gas in storage. Front-month gas futures for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 2.4 cents, or 1.0%, to $2.454 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 8:49 a.m. EDT (1249 GMT), putting the contract on track for its lowest close since May 15 for a second day in a row. Advertisement: The National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC) NGC's HSSE strategy is reflective and supportive of the organisational vision to become a leader in the global energy business. ngc.co.tt In other news, a federal judge dealt U.S. President Joe Biden's climate agenda a setback by blocking the Democrat's administration from continuing to pause the approval of applications to export liquefied natural gas (LNG). In Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), power grid operator for most of the state, said peak demand this week will come close to but not break the record for the month of July as homes and businesses crank up their air conditioners to escape a heat wave. In the spot market, next-day gas prices at the Waha hub in West Texas plunged by about 123% to a negative 52 cents per mmBtu for Tuesday as pipeline constraints trap gas in the Permian Shale again. That is the third time in six days Waha prices fell into negative territory during the current heat wave and the 20th time so far this year. Next-day Waha prices first averaged below zero in 2019. It happened 17 times in 2019, six in 2020, none in 2021 and 2022, and once in 2023. In the Caribbean Sea, Hurricane Beryl, an extremely dangerous major hurricane, will hit Jamaica on Wednesday before slamming slam into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the latest U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) outlook. After marching across the Yucatan, the NHC projected Beryl will weaken into a tropical storm by the time it enters the Bay of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico, where Mexico produces much of its oil, on Saturday before approaching the Texas-Mexico border on Sunday. SUPPLY AND DEMAND Financial firm LSEG said gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states rose to an average of 101.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in July. That was up from an average of 100.1 bcfd in June and a 17-month low of 99.5 bcfd in May as many producers reduced drilling activities after prices fell to 3-1/2-year lows in February and March. U.S. output hit a monthly record high of 105.5 bcfd in December 2023. Meteorologists projected weather across the Lower 48 states would remain hotter than normal through at least July 17. With hotter weather expected next week, LSEG forecast average gas demand in the Lower 48, including exports, will rise from 98.5 bcfd this week to 104.5 bcfd next week. Those forecasts were lower than LSEG's outlook on Monday. Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants fell to 12.2 bcfd so far in July, down from 12.8 bcfd in June and a monthly record high of 14.7 bcfd in December 2023. That decline was due mostly to an expected drop in feedgas at Cheniere Energy's 4.5-bcfd Sabine Pass in Louisiana to a one-week low of 3.7 bcfd on Tuesday, down from 4.1 bcfd on Monday and an average of 4.0 bcfd over the prior seven days.

State oil company Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos (Pemex) produced 3.65 Bcf/d, or 95% of total gas output last month, with private sector operators accounting for the remainder, according to upstream regulator Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Hidrocarburos (CNH). The top five gas producing fields, all operated by Pemex, were Quesqui (570 MMcf/d), Ixachi (507 MMcf/d), Akal (355 MMcf/d), Maloob (138 MMcf/d) and Onel (133 MMcf/d). Associated gas tied to oil production averaged 1.99 Bcf/d, versus 1.86 Bcf/d for non-associated gas. The International Energy Agency is forecasting a major decline in oil supply from Mexico between 2024 and 2030 due to underinvestment in exploration and production (E&P). President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum has signaled her intent to continue the energy policies of her predecessor Andres Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who has sought to solidify Pemex's dominant role in E&P. Sheinbaum on Thursday (June 27) named economist Luz Elena Gonz\u00e1lez Escobar to be the country's next energy secretary. Gonz\u00e1lez Escobar said she would pursue \"an energy policy that will continue to guarantee national sovereignty and will at the same time advance the energy transition.\" L\u00f3pez Obrador and Sheinbaum also both officially oppose hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in Mexico, despite the country's substantial prospective resources of unconventional natural gas. In a June 20 speech, CNH Chairman Agust\u00edn D\u00edaz Lastra - a L\u00f3pez Obrador appointee - said that exploration work should continue so that unconventional prospective resources could be reclassified as reserves. This would allow unconventional projects to be developed more quickly if fracking is authorized, D\u00edaz indicated. Upon taking office in 2018, L\u00f3pez Obrador canceled bid rounds that would have made onshore unconventional gas blocks available for exploration. Meanwhile, gas imports from the United States have accounted for 6.37 Bcf/d, or 72% of Mexico's total gas supply this year through June 19, up 536 MMcf/d from the same period last year, Wood Mackenzie data show. The country's overall gas demand over the same span was down 120 MMcf/d to 8.52 Bcf/d, with only the power sector showing a year/year increase in consumption. Domestic production has accounted for 2.38 Bcf/d, or 27% of Mexican gas supply this year, according to the consultancy. Pemex has consumed 1.56 Bcf/d for its own operations, including enhanced oil recovery and refining. Pemex, for its part, reported a third straight sequential decline in dry gas production from its processing centers to 1.8 Bcf/d in May. Mexico natural gas prices closely track those of the United States due to Mexico's reliance on U.S. imports. Mexico's IPGN monthly natural gas price index averaged $1.922/MMBtu in May 2024, down from $3.159 in May 2023. After slumping below $2.00for much of 2024 so far, Lower 48 natural gas prices have strengthened some with summer underway. NGI's daily Henry Hub spot price averaged $2.390 on Friday.

We have declared war on the challenges affecting our crude oil production. War means war. We have the right tools. We know what to fight. We know what we have to do at the level of assets. We have engaged our partners. And we will work together to improve the situation,\" the GCEO declared.According to him, a detailed analysis of assets revealed that Nigeria can conveniently produce two million barrels of crude oil per day without deploying new rigs, but the major impediment to achieving that remains the inability of players to act in a timely manner.

Expand Here's the latest: August Nymex natural gas futures down 12.3 cents to $2.478/MMBtu as of 2:40 p.m. ET Lower 48 gas production rose to 102 Bcf/d on Sunday, the highest level since March 11, Wood Mackenzie data show Category 4 Hurricane Beryl is tracking to cross Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, potentially avoiding a direct strike on the Lower 48 The August contract started to trade below $2.500/MMBtu before 11 a.m. ET before bouncing on either side of the closely watched level into midday. \"Critical support sits at $2.50,\" EBW Analytics Group analyst Eli Rubin said. Forecasting from DTN shed 6.5 cooling degree days (CDD) from its Lower 48 forecasts over the next three weeks since Friday, equating to 10.4 Bcf lower demand, Rubin said. Maxar's Weather Desk also pointed to cooler temperatures. However, NatGasWeather painted a more mixed picture with weekend updates both shedding and adding modest amounts of CDD in the American and European weather models. Both forecasts continued to point to the hottest first half of July of the past 50 years, however, both models have tended to overestimate summer's heat \"and the expectation is they are doing so again this summer,\" NatGasWeather said. Wood Mackenzie estimated Lower 48 gas production fell to 100.0 Bcf/d on Monday, but analysts expected that number to be revised higher in later cycles because of volatility at the start of the month. Freeport LNG terminal's Train 2 was down about 15 hours from Saturday to Sunday, but flows have bounced back on Monday Cheniere Energy Inc.'s Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas export facility may have completed a round of maintenance U.S. LNG feed gas demand climbed to about 12.9 Bcf/d for Monday, highest since last Sunday, according to NGI's U.S. LNG Export Tracker Freeport staff told Texas officials that the facility's Train 2 tripped because of compressor issues. Feed gas flows fell to about 1.6 Bcf/d Saturday and 1.3 Bcf/d Sunday, NGI data show. On Monday, service regained its earlier June pace with nominations at around 1.9 Bcf/d. Kpler has a ship in berth loading and more scheduled through the week. Meanwhile, an uptick in feed gas flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend hints at the terminal wrapping up its traditional June maintenance. Flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend topped out above 4.3 Bcf on Sunday and were scheduled to be around 4.2 Bcf on Monday, NGI data show. \"The terminal could likely run a bit higher, with optimal summer flows near 4.4 Bcf/d,\" Criterion Research Inc.'s James Bevan, vice president of Research, said on online energy platform Enelyst. Elsewhere, flows to Cheniere's Corpus Christi and Sempra Infrastructure's Cameron LNG terminals were stable at about 2.3 Bcf/d and 1.9 Bcf/d, respectively, NGI data show. NGI modeling 29 Bcf injection into Lower 48 storage for week ending June 28 A print in-line with NGI's estimate for this week's U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report would further eat into the Lower 48's lofty storage surplus. Last week's report showed working gas in underground storage stood at 528 Bcf, or a nearly 21% surplus to the five-year average. All but eight of the last 10 weekly injections have lagged the five-year average, narrowing the surplus from 37% in mid-April. For the week ending June 28, the five-year average is an injection of 69 Bcf, while the year-earlier period saw an 76 Bcf increase. Henry Hub spot prices lower at $2.205, down 18.5 cents, NGI's MidDay Price Alert data show Southeast weaker on cooler forecasts, West Texas prices stay negative Waha rose 8.5 cents to negative $2.035 on Monday, according to NGI's MidDay Price Alert. Transco Zone 5 in the Southeast shed 25.5 cents to average $2.560, as forecasts for the region turned cooler. Weather model runs on Monday pulled Southeast forecasts for the next 10 days below normal while the 11- to 15-day outlook is only now marginally above normal, Bevan said. The cooler look resulted in a demand loss of around 9 Bcf for the region, stacking onto losses from Thursday and Friday, Bevan said. Also likely impacting prices in the Southeast is supply from the Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC (MVP), which officially began firm transport service on Monday. The new pipeline is scheduled to deliver its highest volume yet to the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Co. (aka Transco) on Monday at around 0.97 Bcf/d, or nearly half its capacity, according to Wood Mackenzie flow data. Transco's Station 160 in North Carolina, which is south of the mainline's interconnect with MVP, showed southbound flows into the Southeast rose above 2 Bcf/d Monday, setting a new high for 2024, Bevan said.

Group Chief Executive Officer of NNPC Ltd, Mr. Mele Kyari, disclosed this in a keynote address at the opening ceremony of the 23rd edition of the Nigeria Oil & Gas Conference and Exhibition (NOG Energy Week) in Abuja, on Tuesday. \"We have decided to stop the debate. We have declared war on the challenges affecting our crude oil production. War means war. We have the right tools. We know what to fight. We know what we have to do at the level of assets. We have engaged our partners. And we will work together to improve the situation,\" the GCEO declared. According to him, a detailed analysis of assets revealed that Nigeria can conveniently produce two million barrels of crude oil per day without deploying new rigs, but the major impediment to achieving that remains the inability of players to act in a timely manner. He said the \"war\" will help NNPC Ltd. and its partners to speedily clear all identified obstacles to effective and efficient production such as delays in procurement processes, which have become a challenge in the industry. On medium to long-term measures aimed at boosting and sustaining production, Kyari said NNPC Ltd. would replace all the old crude oil pipelines built over four decades ago and also introduce a rig sharing programme with its partners to ensure that production rigs stay in the country for between four and five years which is the standard practice in most climes. He called on all players in the industry to collaborate towards reducing the cost of production and boosting production to target levels. He expressed the Company's commitment to investing in critical midstream gas infrastructure such as the Obiafu-Obrikom-Oben (OB3) and the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano gas pipelines to boost domestic gas production and supply for power generation, industrial development and economic prosperity of the country. On Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Kyari observed that NNPC Ltd. has since keyed into the Presidential CNG drive, adding that in conjunction with partners such as NIPCO Gas, NNPC Ltd. has built a number of CNG stations, 12 of which will be commissioned on Thursday in Lagos and Abuja. NNPC Ltd. is the Principal Sponsor of 2024 NOG Energy Week Conference & Exhibition which has as its theme \"showcasing opportunities, driving investment and meeting energy demand.\" However, with Nigeria's oil production lagging significantly behind OPEC oil production quota, the Minister for State Petroleum Resources (Oil), Senator Heineken Lokpobiri has expressed the Federal Government's determination to improve production in the coming months. The Minister stated this when he gave his ministerial address at the ongoing 2024 NOG week Lokpobiri emphasized Nigeria's commitment to increasing oil production, adding that while Nigeria \"is not in a rush to transition away from oil, the country is actively seeking to enhance its production capabilities\". According to him, \"We are focused on ramping up our oil production . When we came to office the president was concerned in increasing production in every way. I can confidently tell you that most of the deals like Seplat -ExxonMobil deal and other issues like Malabu deal are being resolved. He highlighted the benefits of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which provides a robust legal framework that guarantees returns on investments and has significantly reshaped the oil and gas sector. \"The PIA ensures a secure and profitable investment climate, making Nigeria an attractive location for investors,\" he noted. .IPPG laments delays in concluding IOCs' divestment transactions The Independent Petroleum Producers Group (IPPG) has expressed concerns over the continuos delays in concluding ongoing divestment transactions by the international oil companies (IOCs). Chairman of IPPG, Mr. Abdulrazaq Isa, raised his members' concerns yesterday in Abuja at the ongoing Nigeria Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week 2024, with the theme: \"Showcasing Opportunities, Driving Investment and Meeting Energy Demand\". In his industry address at the event, Isa specifically said that the long-overdrawn delays in concluding the IOCs divestment deals were costly to the Nigerian petroleum industry and extremely detrimental to the country as a whole. He appreciated President Bola Tinubu for the transformative reforms being undertaken by his administratio, pointing out specifically that the recent presidential executive orders and directives were a welcome development for the industry. \"Also of note is His Excellency's direct intervention in untangling issues in some of the long-overdrawn IOC divestment transactions - these delays have been costly to the industry and extremely detrimental to the nation as a whole. \"We are encouraged to see swift progress on implementation and some tangible results within a relatively short period of time. \"Such progressive and impactful policies are exactly what the industry has consistently clamoured for to sustainably develop and move the industry forward\", Isa stated. Notwithstanding those laudable policies and the gradual positive turnarounds being experienced, he maintained that the industry was in dire need of extraordinary focus to mitigate the genuine concerns on its long-term sustainability. According to him, despite Nigeria's world class hydrocarbon resource base of over 37 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves and 207 trillion cubic feet (tcf) and 600 tcf of proven and contingent gas reserves respectively, we find ourselves in a situation where our daily production has significantly dropped and lies at about 1.3 million barrels of oil and 8.5 bcf of gas today. He noted that the current oil and gas production was way below Nigeria's capacity as a nation. He added that by all globally acceptable standards, this reserves to production ratio was extremely low and a clear indicator that the industry was in a dire situation. In addition, Isa noted that \"we now run the risk of partial implementation of our national budget considering an estimated deficit of 400,000 bpd from the forecasted 1.78 million bpd. This trend in production, according to the IPPG chair, \"portends another frightening dimension when we consider that in the not-too-distant future, our overall installed domestic refining capacity, currently closing in on about 1.2 million barrels per day, may soon outstrip our current crude oil production level with the risk of Nigeria finding itself in a position where it is unable to meet its domestic refinery crude demand or even become a net importer of crude oil, God forbid! \"It is against this scary backdrop that IPPG is calling for urgent measures to be undertaken by all relevant stakeholders to immediately arrest this dwindling production level and under-investment by focusing on the following priority areas.\" On the first priority area, he called for immediate conclusion of all pending IOC divestment transactions. Isa posited that IPPG strongly advocates that their member companies such as Seplat, the Renaissance Consortium and Oando have the proven track record to successfully take over and manage those onshore and shallow water assets to realise incremental production in the region of 100,000 - 200,000 barrels of oil and over 1.5bcf of gas per day within 24 months, and well over 500,000bpd in the long term. He maintained that IPPG believes the timely approval of these IOC divestment transactions would also be a clear signal capable of restoring global investor confidence in Nigeria in an era of competing global investment destinations in Africa and very limited access to capital. On the second priority area, Isa stressed the urgent need to address deepwater development and production in Nigeria. He said untangling issues around deepwater development, particularly in terms of competitive fiscal regime being negotiated with Shell, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil and Chevron has the potential to unlock incremental production of 700,000 bpd from this terrain in the short to medium term. Isa stated, \"Enabling deepwater development will attract significant economic benefits as Nigeria has one of the world's largest untapped deepwater resource base. \"Priority Area 3: The adoption of a national value-retention strategy: Nigeria's domestic crude oil refining and petrochemical capacity must be sustained primarily from our domestic crude oil and gas production in order to transform our country into a net exporter of refined petroleum and petrochemical products that will lay a strong foundation for the rapid industrialization of the Nigerian economy. \"It is therefore imperative to grow our daily production to 2.5 million barrels of oil and 10 bcf of gas in the near to long term to ensure we are able to meet our domestic refinery and petrochemical demands and export commitments to generate the much-needed foreign exchange earnings for macro-economic stability.\" On the fourth priority area, the IPPG boss called for the development of Nigeria's gas resources to catalyse economic growth and complement decarbonisation drive. He stressed that Nigeria's vast gas resources must be exploited with immediate focus placed on restoring production to existing installed Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) capacity and expanding production (FLNG). .We see energy demand rising by 23% by 2045 - OPEC Meanwhile, The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) says energy demand will rise by an estimated 23 per cent by 2025. OPEC says the rise will be fueled by a world economy that is expected to double in size, growing from $138 trillion dollars in 2023 to $270 trillion dollars in 2045. The OPEC Secretary-General, Haitham Al Ghais, made this known on Tuesday at the ongoing 23rd Nigerian Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week Conference and Exhibition, holding in Abuja. The conference, which holds from June 30 to July 4, has its theme as \"Showcasing Opportunities, Driving Investment, Meeting Energy Demand\". Addressing the Strategic Conference via teleconference, Al Ghais explained that it forecasted a rapidly expanding world population that would surpass 9.5 billion people. \"Why are we optimistic? Let us consider these statistics, which are based on OPEC's World Oil Outlook. \"Urbanisation alone will account for over half a billion people moving to cities around the world by 2030. \"This data tells us that the world will require all forms of energy to meet long-term energy needs. \"Oil and gas will remain the predominant fuels in the energy mix. \"In fact, oil alone will retain its share at almost 30 per cent in 2045 as world demand for oil soars to an estimated 116 million barrels per day (mb/d) by that time,\" he said. To meet this rapid and robust growth in energy consumption, he said the industry would need to boost investment levels significantly in the years to come. He said according to its research, cumulative oil-related investment requirements from 2024 until 2045 would amount to $14 trillion dollars or around $610 billion dollars on average per year. \"Securing this vital funding is essential to maintaining security of supply and avoiding unwanted volatility. \"In spite of these facts, I am certain you are aware of some recent predictions for peak demand by 2030 and calls for a discontinuation of investment in hydrocarbons,\" he said. Al Ghais further emphasised that indeed, the rush to adopt \"Net-Zero\" strategies was misguided and simply not realistic. The OPEC Secretary General said that developing countries would continue to balance priorities between developing their national economies and addressing climate change. In this regard, he pledged that OPEC and its member countries would continue to advocate for a fair process for adaptation, mitigation and means of implementation, with regard to climate finance and technology. He decried the fact that there were an estimated 675 million people with no access to basic forms of energy and 2.3 billion without access to clean cooking fuels. He tasked World leaders to unite and advocate for the necessary support and resources to make a difference in addressing this important matter. \"Looking ahead, OPEC will continue to enhance dialogue and cooperation with all of its energy partners, including in Africa,\" Al Ghais said. The Secretary-General, while commending President Bola Tinubu, appreciated Nigeria's staunch commitment to OPEC and to the Declaration of Cooperation.

Expand Here's the latest: August Nymex natural gas futures down 12.3 cents to $2.478/MMBtu as of 2:40 p.m. ET Lower 48 gas production rose to 102 Bcf/d on Sunday, the highest level since March 11, Wood Mackenzie data show Category 4 Hurricane Beryl is tracking to cross Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, potentially avoiding a direct strike on the Lower 48 The August contract started to trade below $2.500/MMBtu before 11 a.m. ET before bouncing on either side of the closely watched level into midday. \"Critical support sits at $2.50,\" EBW Analytics Group analyst Eli Rubin said. Forecasting from DTN shed 6.5 cooling degree days (CDD) from its Lower 48 forecasts over the next three weeks since Friday, equating to 10.4 Bcf lower demand, Rubin said. Maxar's Weather Desk also pointed to cooler temperatures. However, NatGasWeather painted a more mixed picture with weekend updates both shedding and adding modest amounts of CDD in the American and European weather models. Both forecasts continued to point to the hottest first half of July of the past 50 years, however, both models have tended to overestimate summer's heat \"and the expectation is they are doing so again this summer,\" NatGasWeather said. Wood Mackenzie estimated Lower 48 gas production fell to 100.0 Bcf/d on Monday, but analysts expected that number to be revised higher in later cycles because of volatility at the start of the month. Freeport LNG terminal's Train 2 was down about 15 hours from Saturday to Sunday, but flows have bounced back on Monday Cheniere Energy Inc.'s Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas export facility may have completed a round of maintenance U.S. LNG feed gas demand climbed to about 12.9 Bcf/d for Monday, highest since last Sunday, according to NGI's U.S. LNG Export Tracker Freeport staff told Texas officials that the facility's Train 2 tripped because of compressor issues. Feed gas flows fell to about 1.6 Bcf/d Saturday and 1.3 Bcf/d Sunday, NGI data show. On Monday, service regained its earlier June pace with nominations at around 1.9 Bcf/d. Kpler has a ship in berth loading and more scheduled through the week. Meanwhile, an uptick in feed gas flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend hints at the terminal wrapping up its traditional June maintenance. Flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend topped out above 4.3 Bcf on Sunday and were scheduled to be around 4.2 Bcf on Monday, NGI data show. \"The terminal could likely run a bit higher, with optimal summer flows near 4.4 Bcf/d,\" Criterion Research Inc.'s James Bevan, vice president of Research, said on online energy platform Enelyst. Elsewhere, flows to Cheniere's Corpus Christi and Sempra Infrastructure's Cameron LNG terminals were stable at about 2.3 Bcf/d and 1.9 Bcf/d, respectively, NGI data show. NGI modeling 29 Bcf injection into Lower 48 storage for week ending June 28 A print in-line with NGI's estimate for this week's U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report would further eat into the Lower 48's lofty storage surplus. Last week's report showed working gas in underground storage stood at 528 Bcf, or a nearly 21% surplus to the five-year average. All but eight of the last 10 weekly injections have lagged the five-year average, narrowing the surplus from 37% in mid-April. For the week ending June 28, the five-year average is an injection of 69 Bcf, while the year-earlier period saw an 76 Bcf increase. Henry Hub spot prices lower at $2.205, down 18.5 cents, NGI's MidDay Price Alert data show Southeast weaker on cooler forecasts, West Texas prices stay negative Waha rose 8.5 cents to negative $2.035 on Monday, according to NGI's MidDay Price Alert. Transco Zone 5 in the Southeast shed 25.5 cents to average $2.560, as forecasts for the region turned cooler. Weather model runs on Monday pulled Southeast forecasts for the next 10 days below normal while the 11- to 15-day outlook is only now marginally above normal, Bevan said. The cooler look resulted in a demand loss of around 9 Bcf for the region, stacking onto losses from Thursday and Friday, Bevan said. Also likely impacting prices in the Southeast is supply from the Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC (MVP), which officially began firm transport service on Monday. The new pipeline is scheduled to deliver its highest volume yet to the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Co. (aka Transco) on Monday at around 0.97 Bcf/d, or nearly half its capacity, according to Wood Mackenzie flow data. Transco's Station 160 in North Carolina, which is south of the mainline's interconnect with MVP, showed southbound flows into the Southeast rose above 2 Bcf/d Monday, setting a new high for 2024, Bevan said.

    "Content": "US natgas prices ease to 6-week low on rising output, lower LNG feedgas US natgas prices ease to 6-week low on rising output, lower LNG feedgas July 2 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures eased about 1% to a six-week low on rising output, forecasts for less demand over the next two weeks than previously expected due to lower liquefied natural gas (LNG) feedgas and an ongoing oversupply of gas in storage. Front-month gas futures for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 2.4 cents, or 1.0%, to $2.454 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 8:49 a.m. EDT (1249 GMT), putting the contract on track for its lowest close since May 15 for a second day in a row. Advertisement: The National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC) NGC's HSSE strategy is reflective and supportive of the organisational vision to become a leader in the global energy business. ngc.co.tt In other news, a federal judge dealt U.S. President Joe Biden's climate agenda a setback by blocking the Democrat's administration from continuing to pause the approval of applications to export liquefied natural gas (LNG). In Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), power grid operator for most of the state, said peak demand this week will come close to but not break the record for the month of July as homes and businesses crank up their air conditioners to escape a heat wave. In the spot market, next-day gas prices at the Waha hub in West Texas plunged by about 123% to a negative 52 cents per mmBtu for Tuesday as pipeline constraints trap gas in the Permian Shale again. That is the third time in six days Waha prices fell into negative territory during the current heat wave and the 20th time so far this year. Next-day Waha prices first averaged below zero in 2019. It happened 17 times in 2019, six in 2020, none in 2021 and 2022, and once in 2023. In the Caribbean Sea, Hurricane Beryl, an extremely dangerous major hurricane, will hit Jamaica on Wednesday before slamming slam into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the latest U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) outlook. After marching across the Yucatan, the NHC projected Beryl will weaken into a tropical storm by the time it enters the Bay of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico, where Mexico produces much of its oil, on Saturday before approaching the Texas-Mexico border on Sunday. SUPPLY AND DEMAND Financial firm LSEG said gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states rose to an average of 101.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in July. That was up from an average of 100.1 bcfd in June and a 17-month low of 99.5 bcfd in May as many producers reduced drilling activities after prices fell to 3-1/2-year lows in February and March. U.S. output hit a monthly record high of 105.5 bcfd in December 2023. Meteorologists projected weather across the Lower 48 states would remain hotter than normal through at least July 17. With hotter weather expected next week, LSEG forecast average gas demand in the Lower 48, including exports, will rise from 98.5 bcfd this week to 104.5 bcfd next week. Those forecasts were lower than LSEG's outlook on Monday. Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants fell to 12.2 bcfd so far in July, down from 12.8 bcfd in June and a monthly record high of 14.7 bcfd in December 2023. That decline was due mostly to an expected drop in feedgas at Cheniere Energy's 4.5-bcfd Sabine Pass in Louisiana to a one-week low of 3.7 bcfd on Tuesday, down from 4.1 bcfd on Monday and an average of 4.0 bcfd over the prior seven days.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries produced an average of 26.98 million barrels per day in June, marking a decrease of 80,000 barrels per day from the previous month. This slight reduction was attributed to minor cuts in production from Iraq and Nigeria. The survey indicated that Iraq and the UAE did not fully comply with the cuts agreed upon at the beginning of the year with other OPEC members. Additionally, Baghdad was unable to implement the extra production cut it had pledged to compensate for previous overproduction levels. To push crude oil prices higher, the OPEC alliance may need to enforce the committed cuts fully. However, efforts to enhance compliance have shown limited results. In June, Iraq reduced its output by 30,000 barrels per day to 4.25 million barrels per day. This reduction in exports brought the country closer to its assigned quota, but its production still exceeded the quota by approximately 250,000 barrels per day, even without considering additional \"compensatory cuts.\" Related News Bloomberg: Iraq reduced its oil production by 130,000 bpd Iraq boosts oil output by 40,000 bpd in May following OPEC decision Basrah crudes surge following global oil rise Basrah crudes surge despite global oil decline Kirkuk oil production surges to over 360,000 bpd EIA reports surge in Iraqi oil exports to the US Shafaq Live Shafaq Live English English Radio facebook Shafaq news english",

Group Chief Executive Officer of NNPC Ltd, Mr. Mele Kyari, disclosed this in a keynote address at the opening ceremony of the 23rd edition of the Nigeria Oil & Gas Conference and Exhibition (NOG Energy Week) in Abuja, on Tuesday. \"We have decided to stop the debate. We have declared war on the challenges affecting our crude oil production. War means war. We have the right tools. We know what to fight. We know what we have to do at the level of assets. We have engaged our partners. And we will work together to improve the situation,\" the GCEO declared. According to him, a detailed analysis of assets revealed that Nigeria can conveniently produce two million barrels of crude oil per day without deploying new rigs, but the major impediment to achieving that remains the inability of players to act in a timely manner. He said the \"war\" will help NNPC Ltd. and its partners to speedily clear all identified obstacles to effective and efficient production such as delays in procurement processes, which have become a challenge in the industry. On medium to long-term measures aimed at boosting and sustaining production, Kyari said NNPC Ltd. would replace all the old crude oil pipelines built over four decades ago and also introduce a rig sharing programme with its partners to ensure that production rigs stay in the country for between four and five years which is the standard practice in most climes. He called on all players in the industry to collaborate towards reducing the cost of production and boosting production to target levels. He expressed the Company's commitment to investing in critical midstream gas infrastructure such as the Obiafu-Obrikom-Oben (OB3) and the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano gas pipelines to boost domestic gas production and supply for power generation, industrial development and economic prosperity of the country. On Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Kyari observed that NNPC Ltd. has since keyed into the Presidential CNG drive, adding that in conjunction with partners such as NIPCO Gas, NNPC Ltd. has built a number of CNG stations, 12 of which will be commissioned on Thursday in Lagos and Abuja. NNPC Ltd. is the Principal Sponsor of 2024 NOG Energy Week Conference & Exhibition which has as its theme \"showcasing opportunities, driving investment and meeting energy demand.\" However, with Nigeria's oil production lagging significantly behind OPEC oil production quota, the Minister for State Petroleum Resources (Oil), Senator Heineken Lokpobiri has expressed the Federal Government's determination to improve production in the coming months. The Minister stated this when he gave his ministerial address at the ongoing 2024 NOG week Lokpobiri emphasized Nigeria's commitment to increasing oil production, adding that while Nigeria \"is not in a rush to transition away from oil, the country is actively seeking to enhance its production capabilities\". According to him, \"We are focused on ramping up our oil production . When we came to office the president was concerned in increasing production in every way. I can confidently tell you that most of the deals like Seplat -ExxonMobil deal and other issues like Malabu deal are being resolved. He highlighted the benefits of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which provides a robust legal framework that guarantees returns on investments and has significantly reshaped the oil and gas sector. \"The PIA ensures a secure and profitable investment climate, making Nigeria an attractive location for investors,\" he noted. .IPPG laments delays in concluding IOCs' divestment transactions The Independent Petroleum Producers Group (IPPG) has expressed concerns over the continuos delays in concluding ongoing divestment transactions by the international oil companies (IOCs). Chairman of IPPG, Mr. Abdulrazaq Isa, raised his members' concerns yesterday in Abuja at the ongoing Nigeria Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week 2024, with the theme: \"Showcasing Opportunities, Driving Investment and Meeting Energy Demand\". In his industry address at the event, Isa specifically said that the long-overdrawn delays in concluding the IOCs divestment deals were costly to the Nigerian petroleum industry and extremely detrimental to the country as a whole. He appreciated President Bola Tinubu for the transformative reforms being undertaken by his administratio, pointing out specifically that the recent presidential executive orders and directives were a welcome development for the industry. \"Also of note is His Excellency's direct intervention in untangling issues in some of the long-overdrawn IOC divestment transactions - these delays have been costly to the industry and extremely detrimental to the nation as a whole. \"We are encouraged to see swift progress on implementation and some tangible results within a relatively short period of time. \"Such progressive and impactful policies are exactly what the industry has consistently clamoured for to sustainably develop and move the industry forward\", Isa stated. Notwithstanding those laudable policies and the gradual positive turnarounds being experienced, he maintained that the industry was in dire need of extraordinary focus to mitigate the genuine concerns on its long-term sustainability. According to him, despite Nigeria's world class hydrocarbon resource base of over 37 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves and 207 trillion cubic feet (tcf) and 600 tcf of proven and contingent gas reserves respectively, we find ourselves in a situation where our daily production has significantly dropped and lies at about 1.3 million barrels of oil and 8.5 bcf of gas today. He noted that the current oil and gas production was way below Nigeria's capacity as a nation. He added that by all globally acceptable standards, this reserves to production ratio was extremely low and a clear indicator that the industry was in a dire situation. In addition, Isa noted that \"we now run the risk of partial implementation of our national budget considering an estimated deficit of 400,000 bpd from the forecasted 1.78 million bpd. This trend in production, according to the IPPG chair, \"portends another frightening dimension when we consider that in the not-too-distant future, our overall installed domestic refining capacity, currently closing in on about 1.2 million barrels per day, may soon outstrip our current crude oil production level with the risk of Nigeria finding itself in a position where it is unable to meet its domestic refinery crude demand or even become a net importer of crude oil, God forbid! \"It is against this scary backdrop that IPPG is calling for urgent measures to be undertaken by all relevant stakeholders to immediately arrest this dwindling production level and under-investment by focusing on the following priority areas.\" On the first priority area, he called for immediate conclusion of all pending IOC divestment transactions. Isa posited that IPPG strongly advocates that their member companies such as Seplat, the Renaissance Consortium and Oando have the proven track record to successfully take over and manage those onshore and shallow water assets to realise incremental production in the region of 100,000 - 200,000 barrels of oil and over 1.5bcf of gas per day within 24 months, and well over 500,000bpd in the long term. He maintained that IPPG believes the timely approval of these IOC divestment transactions would also be a clear signal capable of restoring global investor confidence in Nigeria in an era of competing global investment destinations in Africa and very limited access to capital. On the second priority area, Isa stressed the urgent need to address deepwater development and production in Nigeria. He said untangling issues around deepwater development, particularly in terms of competitive fiscal regime being negotiated with Shell, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil and Chevron has the potential to unlock incremental production of 700,000 bpd from this terrain in the short to medium term. Isa stated, \"Enabling deepwater development will attract significant economic benefits as Nigeria has one of the world's largest untapped deepwater resource base. \"Priority Area 3: The adoption of a national value-retention strategy: Nigeria's domestic crude oil refining and petrochemical capacity must be sustained primarily from our domestic crude oil and gas production in order to transform our country into a net exporter of refined petroleum and petrochemical products that will lay a strong foundation for the rapid industrialization of the Nigerian economy. \"It is therefore imperative to grow our daily production to 2.5 million barrels of oil and 10 bcf of gas in the near to long term to ensure we are able to meet our domestic refinery and petrochemical demands and export commitments to generate the much-needed foreign exchange earnings for macro-economic stability.\" On the fourth priority area, the IPPG boss called for the development of Nigeria's gas resources to catalyse economic growth and complement decarbonisation drive. He stressed that Nigeria's vast gas resources must be exploited with immediate focus placed on restoring production to existing installed Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) capacity and expanding production (FLNG). .We see energy demand rising by 23% by 2045 - OPEC Meanwhile, The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) says energy demand will rise by an estimated 23 per cent by 2025. OPEC says the rise will be fueled by a world economy that is expected to double in size, growing from $138 trillion dollars in 2023 to $270 trillion dollars in 2045. The OPEC Secretary-General, Haitham Al Ghais, made this known on Tuesday at the ongoing 23rd Nigerian Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week Conference and Exhibition, holding in Abuja. The conference, which holds from June 30 to July 4, has its theme as \"Showcasing Opportunities, Driving Investment, Meeting Energy Demand\". Addressing the Strategic Conference via teleconference, Al Ghais explained that it forecasted a rapidly expanding world population that would surpass 9.5 billion people. \"Why are we optimistic? Let us consider these statistics, which are based on OPEC's World Oil Outlook. \"Urbanisation alone will account for over half a billion people moving to cities around the world by 2030. \"This data tells us that the world will require all forms of energy to meet long-term energy needs. \"Oil and gas will remain the predominant fuels in the energy mix. \"In fact, oil alone will retain its share at almost 30 per cent in 2045 as world demand for oil soars to an estimated 116 million barrels per day (mb/d) by that time,\" he said. To meet this rapid and robust growth in energy consumption, he said the industry would need to boost investment levels significantly in the years to come. He said according to its research, cumulative oil-related investment requirements from 2024 until 2045 would amount to $14 trillion dollars or around $610 billion dollars on average per year. \"Securing this vital funding is essential to maintaining security of supply and avoiding unwanted volatility. \"In spite of these facts, I am certain you are aware of some recent predictions for peak demand by 2030 and calls for a discontinuation of investment in hydrocarbons,\" he said. Al Ghais further emphasised that indeed, the rush to adopt \"Net-Zero\" strategies was misguided and simply not realistic. The OPEC Secretary General said that developing countries would continue to balance priorities between developing their national economies and addressing climate change. In this regard, he pledged that OPEC and its member countries would continue to advocate for a fair process for adaptation, mitigation and means of implementation, with regard to climate finance and technology. He decried the fact that there were an estimated 675 million people with no access to basic forms of energy and 2.3 billion without access to clean cooking fuels. He tasked World leaders to unite and advocate for the necessary support and resources to make a difference in addressing this important matter. \"Looking ahead, OPEC will continue to enhance dialogue and cooperation with all of its energy partners, including in Africa,\" Al Ghais said. The Secretary-General, while commending President Bola Tinubu, appreciated Nigeria's staunch commitment to OPEC and to the Declaration of Cooperation.

The result was within the expected range, and included a bearish revision for the prior week, limiting support for Nymex futures. Expand Ahead of the 12 p.m. ET print, the August futures contract was up 2.0 cents at $2.455/MMBtu. The prompt month ticked lower to $2.452 when the EIA data was released, a day early because of the Fourth of July holiday. About 20 minutes later, the contract stood at $2.456, up 2.1 cents from Tuesday's settlement. Prior to the report, NGI modeled a 29 Bcf build. Early estimates to Reuters ranged from builds of 13 Bcf to 76 Bcf, with an average increase of 41 Bcf. The five-year average build was 69 Bcf for the week, while a year ago it was 76 Bcf.

Expand Here's the latest: August Nymex natural gas futures down 12.3 cents to $2.478/MMBtu as of 2:40 p.m. ET Lower 48 gas production rose to 102 Bcf/d on Sunday, the highest level since March 11, Wood Mackenzie data show Category 4 Hurricane Beryl is tracking to cross Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, potentially avoiding a direct strike on the Lower 48 The August contract started to trade below $2.500/MMBtu before 11 a.m. ET before bouncing on either side of the closely watched level into midday. \"Critical support sits at $2.50,\" EBW Analytics Group analyst Eli Rubin said. Forecasting from DTN shed 6.5 cooling degree days (CDD) from its Lower 48 forecasts over the next three weeks since Friday, equating to 10.4 Bcf lower demand, Rubin said. Maxar's Weather Desk also pointed to cooler temperatures. However, NatGasWeather painted a more mixed picture with weekend updates both shedding and adding modest amounts of CDD in the American and European weather models. Both forecasts continued to point to the hottest first half of July of the past 50 years, however, both models have tended to overestimate summer's heat \"and the expectation is they are doing so again this summer,\" NatGasWeather said. Wood Mackenzie estimated Lower 48 gas production fell to 100.0 Bcf/d on Monday, but analysts expected that number to be revised higher in later cycles because of volatility at the start of the month. Freeport LNG terminal's Train 2 was down about 15 hours from Saturday to Sunday, but flows have bounced back on Monday Cheniere Energy Inc.'s Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas export facility may have completed a round of maintenance U.S. LNG feed gas demand climbed to about 12.9 Bcf/d for Monday, highest since last Sunday, according to NGI's U.S. LNG Export Tracker Freeport staff told Texas officials that the facility's Train 2 tripped because of compressor issues. Feed gas flows fell to about 1.6 Bcf/d Saturday and 1.3 Bcf/d Sunday, NGI data show. On Monday, service regained its earlier June pace with nominations at around 1.9 Bcf/d. Kpler has a ship in berth loading and more scheduled through the week. Meanwhile, an uptick in feed gas flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend hints at the terminal wrapping up its traditional June maintenance. Flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend topped out above 4.3 Bcf on Sunday and were scheduled to be around 4.2 Bcf on Monday, NGI data show. \"The terminal could likely run a bit higher, with optimal summer flows near 4.4 Bcf/d,\" Criterion Research Inc.'s James Bevan, vice president of Research, said on online energy platform Enelyst. Elsewhere, flows to Cheniere's Corpus Christi and Sempra Infrastructure's Cameron LNG terminals were stable at about 2.3 Bcf/d and 1.9 Bcf/d, respectively, NGI data show. NGI modeling 29 Bcf injection into Lower 48 storage for week ending June 28 A print in-line with NGI's estimate for this week's U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report would further eat into the Lower 48's lofty storage surplus. Last week's report showed working gas in underground storage stood at 528 Bcf, or a nearly 21% surplus to the five-year average. All but eight of the last 10 weekly injections have lagged the five-year average, narrowing the surplus from 37% in mid-April. For the week ending June 28, the five-year average is an injection of 69 Bcf, while the year-earlier period saw an 76 Bcf increase. Henry Hub spot prices lower at $2.205, down 18.5 cents, NGI's MidDay Price Alert data show Southeast weaker on cooler forecasts, West Texas prices stay negative Waha rose 8.5 cents to negative $2.035 on Monday, according to NGI's MidDay Price Alert. Transco Zone 5 in the Southeast shed 25.5 cents to average $2.560, as forecasts for the region turned cooler. Weather model runs on Monday pulled Southeast forecasts for the next 10 days below normal while the 11- to 15-day outlook is only now marginally above normal, Bevan said. The cooler look resulted in a demand loss of around 9 Bcf for the region, stacking onto losses from Thursday and Friday, Bevan said. Also likely impacting prices in the Southeast is supply from the Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC (MVP), which officially began firm transport service on Monday. The new pipeline is scheduled to deliver its highest volume yet to the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Co.

Expand Here's the latest: August Nymex natural gas futures down 12.3 cents to $2.478/MMBtu as of 2:40 p.m. ET Lower 48 gas production rose to 102 Bcf/d on Sunday, the highest level since March 11, Wood Mackenzie data show Category 4 Hurricane Beryl is tracking to cross Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, potentially avoiding a direct strike on the Lower 48 The August contract started to trade below $2.500/MMBtu before 11 a.m. ET before bouncing on either side of the closely watched level into midday. \"Critical support sits at $2.50,\" EBW Analytics Group analyst Eli Rubin said. Forecasting from DTN shed 6.5 cooling degree days (CDD) from its Lower 48 forecasts over the next three weeks since Friday, equating to 10.4 Bcf lower demand, Rubin said. Maxar's Weather Desk also pointed to cooler temperatures. However, NatGasWeather painted a more mixed picture with weekend updates both shedding and adding modest amounts of CDD in the American and European weather models. Both forecasts continued to point to the hottest first half of July of the past 50 years, however, both models have tended to overestimate summer's heat \"and the expectation is they are doing so again this summer,\" NatGasWeather said. Wood Mackenzie estimated Lower 48 gas production fell to 100.0 Bcf/d on Monday, but analysts expected that number to be revised higher in later cycles because of volatility at the start of the month. Freeport LNG terminal's Train 2 was down about 15 hours from Saturday to Sunday, but flows have bounced back on Monday Cheniere Energy Inc.'s Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas export facility may have completed a round of maintenance U.S. LNG feed gas demand climbed to about 12.9 Bcf/d for Monday, highest since last Sunday, according to NGI's U.S. LNG Export Tracker Freeport staff told Texas officials that the facility's Train 2 tripped because of compressor issues. Feed gas flows fell to about 1.6 Bcf/d Saturday and 1.3 Bcf/d Sunday, NGI data show. On Monday, service regained its earlier June pace with nominations at around 1.9 Bcf/d. Kpler has a ship in berth loading and more scheduled through the week. Meanwhile, an uptick in feed gas flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend hints at the terminal wrapping up its traditional June maintenance. Flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend topped out above 4.3 Bcf on Sunday and were scheduled to be around 4.2 Bcf on Monday, NGI data show. \"The terminal could likely run a bit higher, with optimal summer flows near 4.4 Bcf/d,\" Criterion Research Inc.'s James Bevan, vice president of Research, said on online energy platform Enelyst. Elsewhere, flows to Cheniere's Corpus Christi and Sempra Infrastructure's Cameron LNG terminals were stable at about 2.3 Bcf/d and 1.9 Bcf/d, respectively, NGI data show. NGI modeling 29 Bcf injection into Lower 48 storage for week ending June 28 A print in-line with NGI's estimate for this week's U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report would further eat into the Lower 48's lofty storage surplus. Last week's report showed working gas in underground storage stood at 528 Bcf, or a nearly 21% surplus to the five-year average. All but eight of the last 10 weekly injections have lagged the five-year average, narrowing the surplus from 37% in mid-April. For the week ending June 28, the five-year average is an injection of 69 Bcf, while the year-earlier period saw an 76 Bcf increase. Henry Hub spot prices lower at $2.205, down 18.5 cents, NGI's MidDay Price Alert data show Southeast weaker on cooler forecasts, West Texas prices stay negative Waha rose 8.5 cents to negative $2.035 on Monday, according to NGI's MidDay Price Alert. Transco Zone 5 in the Southeast shed 25.5 cents to average $2.560, as forecasts for the region turned cooler. Weather model runs on Monday pulled Southeast forecasts for the next 10 days below normal while the 11- to 15-day outlook is only now marginally above normal, Bevan said. The cooler look resulted in a demand loss of around 9 Bcf for the region, stacking onto losses from Thursday and Friday, Bevan said. Also likely impacting prices in the Southeast is supply from the Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC (MVP), which officially began firm transport service on Monday. The new pipeline is scheduled to deliver its highest volume yet to the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Co. (aka Transco) on Monday at around 0.97 Bcf/d, or nearly half its capacity, according to Wood Mackenzie flow data. Transco's Station 160 in North Carolina, which is south of the mainline's interconnect with MVP, showed southbound flows into the Southeast rose above 2 Bcf/d Monday, setting a new high for 2024, Bevan said.

The result was within the expected range, and included a bearish revision for the prior week, limiting support for Nymex futures. Expand Ahead of the 12 p.m. ET print, the August futures contract was up 2.0 cents at $2.455/MMBtu. The prompt month ticked lower to $2.452 when the EIA data was released, a day early because of the Fourth of July holiday. About 20 minutes later, the contract stood at $2.456, up 2.1 cents from Tuesday's settlement. Prior to the report, NGI modeled a 29 Bcf build. Early estimates to Reuters ranged from builds of 13 Bcf to 76 Bcf, with an average increase of 41 Bcf. The five-year average build was 69 Bcf for the week, while a year ago it was 76 Bcf.

Both forecasts continued to point to the hottest first half of July of the past 50 years, however, both models have tended to overestimate summer's heat \"and the expectation is they are doing so again this summer,\" NatGasWeather said. Wood Mackenzie estimated Lower 48 gas production fell to 100.0 Bcf/d on Monday, but analysts expected that number to be revised higher in later cycles because of volatility at the start of the month. Freeport LNG terminal's Train 2 was down about 15 hours from Saturday to Sunday, but flows have bounced back on Monday Cheniere Energy Inc.'s Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas export facility may have completed a round of maintenance U.S. LNG feed gas demand climbed to about 12.9 Bcf/d for Monday, highest since last Sunday, according to NGI's U.S. LNG Export Tracker Freeport staff told Texas officials that the facility's Train 2 tripped because of compressor issues. Feed gas flows fell to about 1.6 Bcf/d Saturday and 1.3 Bcf/d Sunday, NGI data show. On Monday, service regained its earlier June pace with nominations at around 1.9 Bcf/d. Kpler has a ship in berth loading and more scheduled through the week. Meanwhile, an uptick in feed gas flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend hints at the terminal wrapping up its traditional June maintenance. Flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend topped out above 4.3 Bcf on Sunday and were scheduled to be around 4.2 Bcf on Monday, NGI data show. \"The terminal could likely run a bit higher, with optimal summer flows near 4.4 Bcf/d,\" Criterion Research Inc.'s James Bevan, vice president of Research, said on online energy platform Enelyst. Elsewhere, flows to Cheniere's Corpus Christi and Sempra Infrastructure's Cameron LNG terminals were stable at about 2.3 Bcf/d and 1.9 Bcf/d, respectively, NGI data show. NGI modeling 29 Bcf injection into Lower 48 storage for week ending June 28 A print in-line with NGI's estimate for this week's U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report would further eat into the Lower 48's lofty storage surplus. Last week's report showed working gas in underground storage stood at 528 Bcf, or a nearly 21% surplus to the five-year average. All but eight of the last 10 weekly injections have lagged the five-year average, narrowing the surplus from 37% in mid-April. For the week ending June 28, the five-year average is an injection of 69 Bcf, while the year-earlier period saw an 76 Bcf increase. Henry Hub spot prices lower at $2.205, down 18.5 cents, NGI's MidDay Price Alert data show Southeast weaker on cooler forecasts, West Texas prices stay negative Waha rose 8.5 cents to negative $2.035 on Monday, according to NGI's MidDay Price Alert. Transco Zone 5 in the Southeast shed 25.5 cents to average $2.560, as forecasts for the region turned cooler. Weather model runs on Monday pulled Southeast forecasts for the next 10 days below normal while the 11- to 15-day outlook is only now marginally above normal, Bevan said. The cooler look resulted in a demand loss of around 9 Bcf for the region, stacking onto losses from Thursday and Friday, Bevan said. Also likely impacting prices in the Southeast is supply from the Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC (MVP), which officially began firm transport service on Monday. The new pipeline is scheduled to deliver its highest volume yet to the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Co. (aka Transco) on Monday at around 0.97 Bcf/d, or nearly half its capacity, according to Wood Mackenzie flow data. Transco's Station 160 in North Carolina, which is south of the mainline's interconnect with MVP, showed southbound flows into the Southeast rose above 2 Bcf/d Monday, setting a new high for 2024, Bevan said.

    "Content": "Dangote Refinery: Crude oil supply options - Blueprint Newspapers Limited Skip to content The international corporations drilling oil in Nigeria are the country's greatest enemies. They have never hidden their condescension for Nigeria even as they are allowed to operate the industry on their own terms. In fact, the IOCs are partially responsible for Nigeria's total dependence on imported refined petroleum products.The international oil companies (IOCs) are compelled to operate refineries in most of the countries they drill oil. In Nigeria they defiantly snubbed the federal government's directives that they should establish refineries. Their excuse was that no refinery could succeed in Nigeria because the federal government stands around to fix unacceptable pump prices for refined petroleum products.Aliko Dangote, president of the Dangote Group, and some development banks in the international money market came together to prove that the treacherous oil firms exploiting crude oil in Nigeria were telling transparent lies when they refused to establish refineries in Nigeria on the grounds that the pump prices of refined petroleum products were controlled by the federal government. The international money market advanced loans close to $9 billion to Dangote for the establishment of what is now acknowledged as one of the world's largest refineries.No one would advance such a colossal sum as a loan for a venture known to have no means of repaying the loan. The fact that the international development banks were willing to fund Dangote Refinery is a clear indication that the venture was viable and could not be bugged down by government regulation of the pump prices of refined petroleum products.The lies of the IOCs were exposed by the success in sourcing for funds to build a giant refinery in Nigeria.The mischievous oil firms were disgraced as their lies were exposed. They gnashed their teeth and proceeded to wait for Dangote and the Nigerian people down the road.The refinery they were determined to truncate came on stream in January 2024 and in apparent frustration they drew up fresh plans to sabotage the business of the refinery and keep Nigeria as a perpetual importer of refined petroleum products.They know that if Dangote Refinery succeeds, the refineries in Europe that were supplying refined petroleum products to Nigeria at a catastrophic cost of well over $20 billion annually could be out of businessThey decided to use the last weapon in their armoury to frustrate Dangote Refinery. They defiantly refused to sell crude oil to Dangote. Those who reluctantly offer to sell the feedstock put their price tag at $6 above what obtains in the international market.Consequently, Dangote has been compelled to import crude oil for his refinery from the United States of America (USA) when Nigeria remains the highest producer of crude oil in Africa.The treacherous international oil companies operating in Nigeria have finally held Dangote Refinery and the Nigerian people in the jugular.Diesel from Dangote Refinery is more expensive than the high sulfur diesels imported by independent petroleum marketers from Europe into Nigeria.The most painful aspect of the sabotage by the IOCs is that the regulator of the industry sees nothing wrong with collaborating with foreigners to frustrate a Nigerian venture designed to ease the merciless grip of European petroleum refiners on Nigerians.The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) apathetically issues licences to independent petroleum marketers to import diesel from Europe with a weak naira and torment Nigerian consumers with high energy cost that escalates the country's catastrophic inflationary trend.When newsmen confronted the agency on the illogicality of encouraging diesel imports when a Nigerian refinery is ready to supply, NMDPRA retorted that in a deregulated market, marketers are free to source diesel from anywhere.NMDPRA is the regulatory arm of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL). The company is more or less an appendage of the mischievous international oil companies battling to protect the interest of European crude oil refiners patronised by NNPCL.NNPCL, as industry regulator, could order the deceitful IOCs to sell crude oil to Dangote Refinery at international market price. But it could only do so to the detriment of its own selfish interest.NNPCL would lose trillions of naira if Dangote Refinery gets crude oil from Nigeria and sells refined petroleum products locally at reduced pump prices.That would mean the end of the petrol subsidy scandal through which the company rakes in trillions of naira annually. That explains why NNPCL allows foreign exploiters to frustrate Dangote Refinery.NNPCL has unrestrained powers to supply crude oil to Dangote Refinery which at the moment is the only way to ease the asphyxiating hold of high energy cost on Nigeria's economy.If the treacherous IOCs defy NNPCL's directive to supply crude oil to Dangote Refinery at international market rate, the company could do the job by itself.NNPCL allocates 445,000 barrels of crude oil daily to Nigeria's moribund refineries. Nigeria's four refineries have not refined a barrel of crude oil in the last three years.Consequently, NNPCL exports the 445,000 barrels of crude oil daily to foreign refineries that feed Nigeria with refined petroleum products in return. If NNPCL reroutes the crude oil to Dangote Refinery, Nigeria would benefit extensively.The foreign refineries use the residue of the crude oil supplied by NNPCL for their petrochemical products and export them to Nigeria. If Dangote Refinery gets the crude oil, the residue would be used to produce resins that would be used to ease the escalating cost of producing plastic containers in the soft drink and brewery industries.Besides, NNPCL owes Dangote Refinery the sum of $1.7 billion as part of the 20 per cent equity it bought. It was expected to pay back with 300,000 barrels of crude oil daily. Its refusal to supply borders on betrayal of trust.It is rather saddening that Mele Kyari, the man who navigated NNPCL through the horrendous petrol subsidy scandal and crude oil theft, is still its group managing director. The man should do the right thing.

Expand NGI's July Bidweek National Avg. climbed 40.0 cents month/month to $2.215/MMBtu. That was down from $2.560 a year earlier. Trading for the latest bidweek period spanned June 24-26. Weather conditions proved mostly hot across the southern two-thirds of the Lower 48 in that span. National Weather Service (NWS) forecasts call for more of the same through the first half of July, with the heat spreading further to the northern third of the country. NWS outlooks also repeatedly have predicted above-average national temperatures for the summer overall. \"The weather backdrop is simply bullish,\" Pinebrook Energy Advisors' Andy Huenefeld, managing partner, told NGI during bidweek. Several natural gas hubs in California and the Southwest, where scorching temperatures were widespread over the final days of June and forecasted to sizzle further in coming weeks, propelled the overall increase during bidweek. Those regions also are dependent in part on gas from the Permian Basin, where maintenance work amid pipeline constraints in June limited supplies flowing west. SoCal Citygate surged $1.335 month/month to average $3.055, and SoCal Border Avg. jumped $1.235 to $2.565. In the Southwest, KRGT Del Pool spiked $1.150 to $2.740, while El Paso S. Mainline/N. Baja rose $1.400 to $2.600. Futures prices, however, struggled in late June as traders fixated on rising production and robust inventories of gas stored underground. Production consistently held around 100 Bcf/d late last month, rising from spring lows in the mid-90s Bcf/d, according to Wood Mackenzie. The firm on Monday estimated output at 100 Bcf/d. At the same time, supplies in storage remained abundant. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported an injection of 52 Bcf for the week ended June 21. The increase boosted inventories to 3,097 Bcf and put stocks 21% above the five-year average of 2,569 Bcf. The futures market \"is a little bit in a wait-and-see mode, wanting to actually witness the July heat develop as forecasted,\" StoneX Financial Inc.'s Thomas Saal, senior vice president of energy, told NGI. \"Because if that heat doesn't come through, we're going to be sitting on a lot of gas.\" Futures Pressure On the final day of the latest bidweek period, the July Nymex natural gas futures contract rolled off the board with a 12.8-cent loss. It settled at $2.628 on that Wednesday, down 3% from the prior week's close. It had lost ground the previous week as well. The August contract moved to the front of the curve last Thursday and fell 6.0 cents in that session and another 8.4 cents the following day. On Monday, it settled at $2.478, down 12.3 cents. \"We remain focused on rising natural gas production in mid-summer as drillers return deferred supply to the market,\" said EBW Analytics Group's Eli Rubin, senior analyst. Any \"downturn in cooling demand could send gas tumbling.\" Still, Rubin noted the forecasts point to solid demand ahead, and on the storage front, the surplus to the five-year average has narrowed over the past two months. With the latest EIA print, the surfeit declined by two percentage points. It has been cut in half since topping 40% in March. If that continues alongside scorching mid-summer conditions, he said, futures could rally. \"In the most likely scenario, record July heat may reinforce support for gas prices, whittle down storage surpluses, and allow\" the August contract \"to rebound towards $3.00 in the near-to-medium term.\" Catalysts Ahead While rising production creates a bearish undercurrent to watch closely, Rubin also noted that several new LNG facilities are in the works along the Gulf Coast that could double liquefied natural gas demand before the end of this decade. The first of them could open later this year, launching the trend. Notably, in late June, Texas Eastern Transmission LP began feeding gas to a pending Venture Global LNG Inc. export terminal through Gator Express in Louisiana. The initial test volumes to Plaquemines LNG indicated the facility was on track \"to start exporting in late 2024,\" Wood Mackenzie analyst Nadeem Ahmed said. Rubin described the testing as \"a momentous\" for Venture Global LNG. \"The speed of the near-term ramp up at Plaquemines may offer sufficient demand for natural gas to ward off oversupply later this year,\" he said. Wood Mackenzie data showed gas flows to LNG export facilities at 12.5 Bcf on Monday, up from an average of 12 Bcf/d last week. In the near term, NWS forecasts showed hotter-than-normal high temperatures from the upper 80s to 100s canvassing large swaths of the country from the Southwest to the East Coast this week. \"The first week of July marks the approximate six weeks of the year that typically bring the hottest conditions to most of the nation,\" said AccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski. \"When temperatures exceed the historical average even by a few degrees this time of the year, the heat can be dangerous.\" For the second week of July, highs from the 80s to low 90s were expected to spread over northern markets, while temperatures in the upper 80s to 100s were predicted to remain prevalent throughout southern areas. That would mark a continuation from late June. Strong heat in the final week of the month was expected to result in a seasonally light storage injection with the next EIA report on Wednesday - a day earlier than usual this week because of the Fourth of July holiday on Thursday. Preliminary injection estimates submitted to Reuters for the week ended June 28 ranged from 13 Bcf to 76 Bcf, with an average of 41 Bcf. NGI modeled a build of 29 Bcf. That compares with a five-year average increase of 69 Bcf. With those bullish factors in play, NGI's Patrick Rau, senior vice president of Research & Analysis, said Monday that futures were \"well into oversold territory now.\" However, he added, since the August contract fell below $2.50, \"there could be some follow-on selling down toward the next technical support level in the $2.40 range.\" Related Tags natural gas production weather Kevin Dobbs Kevin Dobbs joined the staff of NGI in April 2020.

    "Content": "OPEC: Global crude oil demand will rise to 116m bpd in 2045 - TV360 Nigeria The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) says world demand for oil is projected to rise to an estimated 116 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2045. Haitham Al Ghais, OPEC secretary-general, spoke on Tuesday in Abuja at the ongoing 23rd Nigerian Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week Conference and Exhibition. The conference is themed 'Showcasing Opportunities, Driving Investment, Meeting Energy Demand'. Addressing the conference via teleconference, Al Ghais said the world economy is expected to double in size - growing from $138 trillion in 2023 to $270 trillion in 2045. He explained that the oil cartel forecasted a rapidly expanding world population that would surpass 9.5 billion people. \"Why are we optimistic? Let us consider these statistics, which are based on OPEC's World Oil Outlook,\" he said. \"Urbanisation alone will account for over half a billion people moving to cities around the world by 2030. Al Ghais said in the upcoming years, the industry will need to significantly increase investment levels in order to keep up with the rapid and robust growth in energy consumption. He said according to its research, the total oil-related investment requirements between 2024 and 2045 would be $14 trillion or about $610 billion on average per year. \"Securing this vital funding is essential to maintaining security of supply and avoiding unwanted volatility,\" Al Ghais said. \"In spite of these facts, I am certain you are aware of some recent predictions for peak demand by 2030 and calls for a discontinuation of investment in hydrocarbons.\" Al Ghais pledged that OPEC and its member countries would keep pushing to advocate for a fair process for adaptation, mitigation and means of implementation with regard to climate finance and technology. The secretary-general said an estimated 675 million people lack access to basic forms of energy and 2.3 billion without access to clean cooking fuels. Al Ghais, while commending President Bola Tinubu, appreciated Nigeria's unwavering commitment to OPEC and the declaration of cooperation (DoC).

This was the highest since May 2023 when imports from Russia stood at 2.15 million barrels per day. Imports of Urals reached their all-time high 1.6 million barrels per day in June. 'India's imports of Urals have reached an all-time high, never on record did Indian refiners buy more than 1.6 million b/d. India has resumed purchases of Russian grades from the Far East such as ESPO or Sokol, however the quantities thereof are lower than they were on average in 2023,' said Viktor Katona, lead crude analyst at Kpler.

Crude oil imports from Russia up by 15 per cent month-on-month, 2 per cent year-on-year By Rishi Ranjan Kala Comments Share Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppReddit READ LATER Remove See All India's crude oil imports from Russia rose to 1.97 million barrels per day (mbpd) during June 2024, the highest since July 2023, largely due to lower cargoes to China.According to data from energy intelligence firm Vortexa, imports from Russia were up by almost 15 per cent month-on-month and 2 per cent on an annual basis. Data shows that both public and private sector refiners continued to import in record quantities from Russia.Public refiners such as Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) imported 1.10 mbpd crude oil, which is also a 12-month high. The cargoes last month were higher by 6 per cent M-o-M. However, imports were down by almost 11 per cent on an annual basis. During May-July 2023, public refiners imported more than 1.2 mbpd on a monthly basis from Russia.Private refiners Reliance Industries (RIL) and Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy imported a record 871,200 barrels per day (bpd) from Russia in June 2024. The cargoes were higher by 28 per cent M-o-M and 20 per cent Y-o-Y. Also read Crude oil up as market expects demand boost during US travel season Consumption of transport fuels declines in June, after May's record high End of petrodollar? We wouldn't hold our breath Vortexa's head of APAC analysis Serena Huang told businessline , \"India's imports of Russian crude at 1.97 mbpd in June 2024 is the highest since last July. China's lower appetite of Russian crude has led to more barrels heading to India.\" Import momentum India's crude imports have remained robust at 4.62 mbpd in June, Huang said. \"We expect the country's crude imports to remain robust, with downside risks from softer refining margins due to slowing global oil demand,\" she added. While Indian refiners procured more barrels from Russia, cargoes from traditional suppliers in West Asia, such as Iraq and Saudi Arabia, declined.Crude oil imports from India's second largest supplier, Iraq, fell by 20 per cent M-o-M and by 3.5 per cent Y-o-Y to roughly 754,000 bpd in June 2024. The decline was steeper in in-bound shipments from Saudi Arabia at 36 per cent M-o-M and 46 per cent Y-o-Y to around 387,000 bpd. Some trade sources said that the higher official selling price (OSP) of its flagship medium sour grade Arab Light in June could have been a reason for the lower cargoes. Crude oil shipments from the US continued to rise for the second consecutive month in June 2024. India imported roughly 331,000 bpd from the US last month, compared to around 224,000 bpd in May 2024 and 112,000 bpd in April. Trade sources said the imports were of light sweet grade due to weak market fundamentals amid refinery outages in Europe.

Data provided by intelligence firm Vortexa showed this. As per data, India imported 2.13 million barrels of crude oil per day from Russia last month, up 7.2% from the previous month. This was the highest since May 2023 when imports from Russia stood at 2.15 million barrels per day. Imports of Urals reached their all-time high 1.6 million barrels per day in June. 'India's imports of Urals have reached an all-time high, never on record did Indian refiners buy more than 1.6 million b/d. India has resumed purchases of Russian grades from the Far East such as ESPO or Sokol, however the quantities thereof are lower than they were on average in 2023,' said Viktor Katona, lead crude analyst at Kpler.

Meanwhile, import volumes from Iraq and Saudi Arabia, the other top suppliers of crude oil to India, declined by 24% and 25% on month respectively. June imports from Saudi Arabia came in at a mere 430,000 barrels per day, the lowest monthly figure since January 2014. Saudi Arabia's market share in India's crude imports reduced to 9% last month compared to 11% in May. Iraq's crude market share, too, declined to 17% in June from 21% in May. Cumulatively, the country imported 4.74 million barrels per day of crude oil in June, marginally up from 4.67 million barrels per day imported in June 2023.
