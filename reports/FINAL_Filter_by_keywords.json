China used to import more than a third of its oil supplies from Africa but by 2022, that figure had dropped to about one-tenth, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC), an online data platform. According to Carnegie's report entitled 'How Is China's Economic Transition Affecting its Relations with Africa?', between 2019 and 2023, there were dramatic increases in China's imports of oil from Malaysia (408%), the UAE (254%), Kazakhstan (214%) and Kuwait (41%). By contrast, during the same period, all eight major African oil producers, except Chad, earned much less than they did before the pandemic, according to the report. Angola has fallen down the list from being China's No. 2 source of crude oil a decade ago to the eighth place in the ranking today. The sharp declines in China's oil imports from Angola, but also South Sudan (77%), Sudan (67%) and Nigeria (61%), for example, have been due to a number of factors, observers say, including geopolitical considerations, lack of investment in equipment and new oil fields and domestic political problems. As China's oil imports from Africa decline, it is increasingly turning to the more predictable production infrastructure of the Gulf countries and Russia and other Asian countries, according to the report from the Washington-based think tank.

Chinese economic data, including disappointing GDP growth and declining refinery output, raises concerns about oil demand. The focus shifts from supply concerns in the US to demand worries in China. Technical analysis suggests potential for a triple bottom pattern in oil prices, with key support and resistance levels identified. Most Read: The Week Ahead - ECB Spotlight as Fed Rate Speculations Drive Market Shifts Oil prices remained resilient this morning following a turbulent weekend. An attack on US Presidential hopeful Donald Trump has seen the US Dollar start the week on the front foot but Oil prices have held firm. Data out of China this morning stoked fears around demand once more, something which market participants had hoped was in the rearview mirror. The overall fundamental picture remains largely positive but demand concerns may hamper any further gains in the short-term. Chinese Data China's GDP data released this morning was disappointing as sluggish domestic demand bites. The data prompted several investment banks to lower their GDP forecasts. GDP growth slowed to 0.7% quarter-on-quarter (q/q) seasonally adjusted (SA) in Q2, down from 1.6% q/q in Q1 and below market expectations of 0.9%, impacted by slower retail sales growth. Domestic demand and consumer confidence remain weak, with the NBS also attributing the slowdown to extreme weather events and flooding. Although industrial output growth is cooling, it exceeded market expectations, highlighting the uneven nature of China's recovery. Strong exports are supporting manufacturing activity, with shipments rising 8.6% year-on-year (y/y) in June, up from 7.6% in May. The secondary industry, which includes manufacturing and construction, grew by 5.6% y/y in Q2, down from 6.0% in Q1, while the tertiary industry, or services, increased by 4.2%, down from 5.0%. Chinese GDP Q2 YoY Source: LSEG (click to enlarge) Chinese refinery output declined for the third consecutive month due to planned maintenance and weak fuel demand, leading independent plants to reduce production. Output for the first half of the year was down 0.4% compared to the same period last year, indicating a sluggish economic recovery and reduced processing profits for refineries. Crude oil imports for the month of June dropped 11% while H1 imports were down 2.3% YoY. According to the IEA the Chinese share of global oil demand growth is declining to 40% this year from last year's 70%. This decline in China has reignited worries about demand, a notable shift from the past two weeks where supply concerns were prevalent in the US. The Week Ahead Oil inventory data is very important as the US and Europe are currently in the middle of summer. This period is typically the peak driving season in the US, leading to high demand for petroleum and other oil-related products. Due to the busy summer season in the US, there is a good chance that weekly oil inventories will decrease more than expected. This could help keep oil prices strong and prevent any significant long-term price drops. Geopolitics also remains a concern and could once more play an important role in the absence of high impact US economic data. For all market-moving economic releases and events (GMT-Time), see the MarketPulse Economic Calendar. (click to enlarge) Technical Analysis Oil prices snapped a four week winning streak to close around 2.33% lower. The weekly timeframe has price testing the 100-day MA which could prove to be a stern area of resistance. The daily timeframe is even more interesting as it appears markets could be setting up a triple bottom pattern. Such a pattern would no doubt embolden bulls eyeing further appreciation in oil prices. A daily candle close below the 85.25 handle opens up a potential selloff in Brent crude with support levels at 83.50 and 82.50 coming into focus. Immediate resistance rests at 86.21 with a break above carrying oil toward 87.90 and potentially the 90.00 psychological level.

I agreeI declineChange my preferences US Europe Arab Asia Africa | Politics Economy Oil&Energy Entertainment Sport Oil prices surge amid political uncertainty, geopolitical tensions Date 7/16/2024 4:45:28 AM Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter (MENAFN) Oil prices saw a modest increase on Monday as geopolitical uncertainty in the United States and the Middle East outweighed pressures from a stronger dollar and subdued demand in China. brent crude futures edged up by 15 cents, or 0.2 percent, to reach USD85.18 per barrel by 0425 GMT, following a slight decline of 37 cents on Friday. Similarly, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose by 20 cents to USD82.41 per barrel, marking a 0.2 percent gain.The attempted assassination of U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump earlier in the week contributed to market uncertainty, according to Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG. This event has cast a shadow over the political landscape of a deeply divided country as it approaches the election period, potentially influencing market sentiment.Geopolitical risks in the Middle East also played a role in supporting oil prices, highlighting ongoing concerns about regional stability. Furthermore, the market remains bolstered by the continuing supply cuts by OPEC+ members. Iraq's oil ministry has pledged to counter any excess oil production starting from 2024, indicating a commitment to manage global supply levels amidst market fluctuations.Despite these factors, oil prices had faced downward pressure last week. Brent crude had declined by more than 1.7 percent after four consecutive weeks of gains, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures dropped by 1.1 percent. This decline was attributed to weak demand for oil in China, the largest importer of crude globally, where crude oil imports fell by 2.3 percent in the first half of the year to 11.05 million barrels per day. Factors contributing to this decline included disappointing fuel demand and reduced output by independent refiners amid narrow profit margins.China's economic slowdown in the second quarter, exacerbated by challenges such as a prolonged property downturn and job market instability, has raised expectations for additional stimulus measures from Beijing to bolster domestic demand. These developments are closely monitored by market participants for potential implications on global oil consumption and economic recovery trends.

    "Content": "Crude oil falls after weak Chinese growth - London Business News | Londonlovesbusiness.com Tech Property Business London Loves Home Business News Crude oil falls after weak Chinese growth IMAGO/Westlight / Avalon Business NewsEconomic NewsFinance NewsInvestment News Crude oil falls after weak Chinese growth by Antonio Ernesto Di Giacomo Market Analyst Latam at XS.com July 16, 2024 written by Antonio Ernesto Di Giacomo Market Analyst Latam at XS.com 16 th Jul 24 10:26 am Crude oil prices fell slightly on Monday as weak Chinese data raised doubts about the growth of this significant economy. The slowdown in the world's second-largest economy has caused investors' concern, impacting global crude oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell from the market opening, dropping from $81.20 to $80.45 per barrel. Meanwhile, Brent crude also declined, trading at $83.80 per barrel. These drops reflect market concerns over China's economic weakness, a country that plays a crucial role in global oil demand. The world's second-largest economy recorded its weakest year-on-year growth in the second quarter. Forecasts indicated a 5.1% growth, but actual growth was 4.7%. This figure surprised analysts and generated uncertainty about China's ability to maintain its growth pace shortly. Additionally, China's crude oil imports fell by 2.3% in the first half of this year, standing at 11.05 million barrels per day. This decrease in imports is due to disappointing fuel demand, suggesting that economic activity in the country is not as robust as expected. These data indicate that China faces increasing economic headwinds, likely a bad sign for crude oil demand in this vital market. The decline in Chinese demand could have a significant impact on global oil prices, given China's weight in global energy consumption. Losses have been limited as political uncertainty in the United States and the Middle East has supported prices. Despite weak Chinese demand, other geopolitical factors have maintained stability in crude oil prices, preventing more pronounced declines. In conclusion, the weakening of Chinese economic growth has immediately impacted crude oil prices, reflecting concerns about future oil demand. Although geopolitical factors have limited declines, China's economic situation will remain a key factor to monitor in the coming months to understand the evolution of crude oil prices in the global market.

[www.gdi.com.qa] TEMPO.CO , Jakarta - World oil prices fell on Tuesday, July 16. Reuters reported that Brent crude fell 9 cents, or 0.1 percent, to US$84.76 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 13 cents, or 0.2 percent, to US$81.78 per barrel. Reuters wrote that the drop in global oil prices was due to concerns over declining demand from China amid the country's economic slowdown. In the second quarter of 2024, China's economy grew at a much slower rate than forecast, triggered by a prolonged property downturn and job insecurity. In April-June 2024, China's economy was recorded to have grown 4.7 percent, the slowest since Q1/2023 and below the 5.1 percent estimated in a Reuters poll. China's oil refinery output also fell 3.7 percent in June. The three-month drop in output was due to planned maintenance. Meanwhile, lower refining margins and sluggish fuel demand are prompting independent mills to cut production.Meanwhile, Fed chair Jerome Powell said that U.S. inflation readings in the second quarter of this year slightly increased confidence that the rate of price increases was returning to the central bank's target on a sustainable basis. His statement was interpreted by market players as an indication of a shift to lower interest rates, possibly soon. Lower interest rates are expected to lower borrowing costs, allowing economic activity and oil demand to increase.

When we get to those countries, we'll start negotiating with them. We'll start bringing in from there. \"We have just bought from US and Brazil. So I think by next month, we'll expand the scope to most of African countries. \"If we availability in Nigeria, we won't have to turn to these other countries,\" Dangote said.When asked about the timeline for sourcing crude from these African countries, Dangote stated that it could begin as soon as next month. News continues after this ad \"Very soon. I think by next month. You know crude, you have to book two months in advance. So, I'll say October we'll be bringing in from these African countries,\" Dangote responded. Feedstock from US, Brazil According to recent reports, Dangote refinery secured 6 million barrel crude oil from US, which is expected to reach the $19 billion facility by August.In addition, the mega refinery will also receive about 5 million barrel of crude oil from US by September, data from Bloomberg show.Accordingly, Dangote is also sourcing crude from the South American country, Brazil, in the coming months to ramp up production as it sets to commence the supply of petrol to the market this month.The leadership of Dangote has vehemently lamented the unavailability of crude in Nigeria, forcing the oil facility to seek alternatives from other countries. IOCs unable to supply local refineries Despite being a leading oil producer, Nigeria still struggles to meet its OPEC quota as well as supply local refineries in the country.Some local refineries, including Dangote, have accused International Oil Companies (IOCs) of refusal to meet their demands, alleging that these IOCs prefer to sell the crude abroad.In response, the regulatory body of oil in Nigeria, NUPRC, has insisted that the IOCs meet local demands first, before exporting to other African countries. PMS Supply expected in July Moreover, Dangote has said his refinery will supply petrol to local marketers this month.Dangote mentioned that the change in date was due to a slight delay, prompting the shift from the originally proposed June to mid-July.The CEO said the refinery will commence production of petrol between 10 and 15 of July, while supply to local marketers will commence from the third week of the same month. \"We had a bit of delay, but PMS will start coming out by 10 to 15 of July. But then we want to keep it in tank to make sure that it settles. So by third week of July, we'll be able coming out to take it into the market,\" Dangote said.The refinery is expected to significantly reduce Nigeria's dependence on imported petroleum products.

It is not patriotic on the side of the people in government to allow this to happen. Our local refineries ought to get crude first before exporting the excess to other countries. By this action government and NNPC and all regulators concern have proved to us that making money for themselves is more important than Nigeria economy and her citizen s welfare. There should be immediate ban on crude oil exchange or swap for refined products outside Nigeria. If there should be any, it should be given to Dangote Refinery or any of the local Refineries not foreign Refineries.

    "Content": "Oil prices tumble as demand worries in China | Al Bawaba Skip to main content Home BUSINESS Oil prices tumble as demand worries in China Oil prices tumble as demand worries in China Published July 16th, 2024 - 07:50 GMT FacebookTwitterWhatsAppShare Shutterstock Oil prices decreased on Tuesday as the weak economic data in China caused worries about a slowing economy crimping demand in the world's largest crude oil importer. International benchmark Brent crude traded at $84.23 per barrel at 09.39 a.m. local time (0639GMT), a decline of 0.73% from the closing price of $84.85 per barrel in the previous trading session.The American benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded at $80.22 per barrel at the same time, a 0.77% fall from the previous session that closed at $80.84 per barrel.The gross domestic product (GDP) of China rose by 4.7% in the second quarter of 2024, below market expectations, according to official figures on Monday.The country's economy expanded by 5.3% in the first quarter, and the market forecast was a GDP growth rate of 5.1% in the second quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics said.This comes after data last week showed softness in oil imports, according to Daniel Hynes, a commodity strategist at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.\"Over the first six months of the year, the world's top importer bought less crude oil compared with last year. June crude oil imports fell on both a monthly and annual basis to 46.45 million tons,\" Hynes said in an e-mailed note.Hynes also added that a stronger US dollar emerged as investors ratcheted up their bets that former US President Trump would win back the White House, which dented investor appetite. The US dollar index rose by 0.18% to 104.065 at 09.39 a.m. local time (0639GMT), compared to the previous trading session close. The higher US dollar curbs oil demand and supports price declines.Trump was targeted in an assassination attempt during a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, just days before he was set to accept the Republican nomination for a third term.However, increased expectations that the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) interest rate cut will start soon limited further price declines.The Fed is receiving \"more good\" inflation data, paving the way for its first interest rate cut later this year, Chair Jerome Powell said Monday.Speaking at the Economic Club of Washington, DC, Powell reiterated his comments that the US central bank is looking for \"greater confidence\" that inflation is returning to its 2% target.Powell noted the Fed does not need to wait until inflation hits its 2% long-term target to begin lowering interest rates because of the lagging effect of monetary tightening on inflation data.Market players interpreted Powell's remarks as a return to interest rate cuts may not be far off.Lower interest rates are set to reduce the cost of consumer borrowing and stoke expectations of increased economic growth and demand for oil.

    "Content": "Oil futures: Crude prices extend losses on economic, demand concerns Oil futures: Crude prices extend losses on economic, demand concerns Crude Oil Refined Products 16 Jul 2024 Quantum Commodity Intelligence - Crude oil futures Tuesday were sliding lower as concerns over broader economic growth offset increasing prospects for a September US rate cut. Front-month Sep24 ICE Brent futures were trading at $83.75/b (1900 GMT), compared to Monday's settle of $84.85/b and an intraday low of $83.30/b. At the same time Aug24 NYMEX WTI was trading at $80.77/b , versus Monday's settle of $81.91/b. Markets remained subdued in the early part of the week despite Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicating that the nation's central bank does not need to see inflation at 2% before cutting rates. \"The implication of that is that if you wait until inflation gets all the way down to 2%, you've probably waited too long, because the tightening that you're doing, or the level of tightness that you have, is still having effects which will probably drive inflation below 2%,\" Powell said in Monday's comments to the Economic Club of Washington, DC. The comments came after last Thursday's lower-than-expected inflation report lifted the prospect of a long-awaited interest rate cut this September, in turn boosting economic growth and oil consumption. China Benchmarks opened the week softer after disappointing GDP figures from China, while crude oil throughput continued to slide last month as thin margins weighed on utilisation rates across the country. The Chinese National Bureau of Statistics data showed Asia's biggest oil refiner processing 58.32 million mt of crude oil in June, equating to 14.19 million bpd. \"The weak economic data in China also weighed on sentiment in the crude oil market. This comes after data last week showed softness in oil imports. Over the first six months of the year,\" said ANZ commodity strategist Daniel Hynes, adding there are also concerns that demand in the US peaked during the 4 July holiday. Elsewhere, investors continue to monitor stop-start ceasefire talks on the Gaza conflict, while Houthi militants have launched three attempted attacks on regional shipping, including an oil tanker, as the Yemen-based group expands its range to the Mediterranean. This included Houthis publishing a video of a uncrewed surface vessel (USV) hitting the crude oil tanker Chios Lion in the Red Sea on 15 July. The North Sea physical market was also in retreat this week as flagship Forties traded in Monday's MOC window at +$0.60/b to the underlying Dated Brent swap on a FOB basis, having last traded at +1/b on Wednesday. twitter linkedin send print Related Total sees higher Q2 output, slump in refinery margins Crude Oil Refined Products 16 Jul 2024 TotalEnergies sees upstream output at the higher end of its second-quarter guidance, the company said Tuesday...

    "Content": "The interplay of inclusiveness, technology and sustainability in today's turbulent trade finance landscape | Global Trade Review (GTR) Share this The interplay of inclusiveness, technology and sustainability in today's turbulent trade finance landscape Sponsored Statement / 15-07-24 / by GTR Amit Agarwal, MD and group head of trade products, Global Transaction Services at DBS Bank, provides an overview of the Asia Pacific trade industry, from the challenges brought about by geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty, to the opportunities arising from regulatory support and technological advancements. The trade industry in Asia Pacific is experiencing turbulent times as geopolitical challenges and macroeconomic uncertainty affect trade volumes and financing in the region. Ongoing geopolitical tensions between the big markets continue to stoke movement among Western companies to explore nearshoring or diversification strategies, resulting in impacts on the trade finance market. While the full effect of these shifts from a trade finance perspective is only likely to emerge over the next two to three years once capex investments have been made, procurement for many goods has started to move to Southeast Asia, Mexico and India, reducing China's direct market share to the Western world. Compounding issues is the broader slowdown in the domestic Chinese economy - headwinds in the real estate sector1 have led to overall slower, though still positive, trade growth in Asia Pacific in 2023. Against this backdrop, a key avenue for growth in many Asian economies (including India) will be the considerable spend expected on infrastructure projects by governments and through public-private partnerships. The participation of mid-cap companies and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in this space will also play a critical role in moving these projects forward. For now, Asia's cross-border trade finance market has also been hit by the high interest rate environment. High US dollar interest rates are making companies reluctant to borrow from banks, and resulting in many of them turning to internal cash flows to manage their working capital. While large corporations have the cash required to do this, SMEs continue to pay high interest rates when borrowing from banks. Hurdles to SME trade financing access SMEs account for a large share of enterprises and jobs globally, but face higher trade costs and have less access to financing. According to the Asian Development Bank,2 roughly 43% of SMEs report having unmet financing needs, resulting in the global trade finance gap expanding from US$1.7tn to US$2.5tn3 in two years. While these numbers are daunting, the reality on the ground is more nuanced. For the most part, larger SMEs (firms with a turnover of more than US$20mn) tend to be sufficiently banked, especially in major Asian markets like India and China. However, in instances where SMEs can access financing, these loans usually come in the form of secured financing - which depends on businesses pledging their fixed assets as collateral - and at very high interest rates. That can limit profitability and constrain SMEs' expansion and growth potential. Additionally, conventional trade finance is intrinsically expensive for banks to service, with high operational costs incurred in processing reams of documentation, security perfection, validating data, and so on. Banks have historically found it challenging to provide low-cost trade financing to SMEs. The industry must do more to enable an inclusive trade financing environment, given the crucial role it plays in supporting trade, and in financing sustainable development. Achieving net-zero targets, for example, hinges on more democratic access to sustainable trade financing. Investing more time and resources into supporting SMEs is key to driving the sustainability agenda for the large upstream corporates. In our view, two aspects are going to be key in broadening access to financing solutions and spurring development worldwide: regulation and technology. The driving force of regulation We are seeing heartening developments in the regulatory landscape in large markets such as India, China and Vietnam, with policymakers developing new rules that actively support more trade finance by creating laws that enable these forms of lending. For example, the creation of trade receivable registries enables banks to log their rights over these exposures and reduce losses on account of double financing issues. Other regulations take a more direct approach. In India, the launch of the Reserve Bank of India's Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS)4 has already led to the collateral-free trade financing of more than US$14bn of domestic trade in 2023. Changes in trade credit insurance guidelines and the launch of Gift City, an international financial centre, aim to multiply the success and expand benefits to cross-border trade as well. In China, regulators have been avid supporters of trade financing for decades. Most recently, in 2023, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange introduced nine new measures5 to facilitate cross-border trade, investment and financing to help stabilise foreign trade and investment. Technology as a catalyst While favourable regulations can help spur trade financing, effectively managing and cutting operational costs will have an equal impact and result in lower-cost trade finance. This will come about by leveraging digital technologies to save resources spent on tedious document evaluations or time-consuming onboarding processes. These technological changes are occurring in different ways. Digital marketing, for one, is dramatically broadening the reach of banks to quickly market trade finance solutions to a vast customer base. Until now, SMEs with turnovers of less than US$20mn faced challenges in accessing trade finance due to the high costs associated with acquisition and servicing. Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for customer servicing and transaction processing can change this. Fintechs have taken the lead in this regard, but established institutions like DBS Bank are also heavily investing in this space. Secondly, industry-grade digital information services are helping to streamline trade transaction processing such as document verification processes. In India, for example, banks have been able to readily access GST information6 online since 2017 to enable rapid verification of invoice data, which means they do not need to physically screen paper trade documents to weed out fraudsters. In Singapore, meanwhile, the MAS-sponsored trade finance registry7 will also help banks identify duplicate invoice financing. A third aspect is the e-commerce wave, which has significantly expanded Asia Pacific's trade industry over the past few years and helped create a new crop of digital solutions to tackle more niche segments. For smaller SMEs in this sector, banks leverage an alternative lending model known as \"cloud cashflow-based financing\" that plugs banking solutions into existing e-commerce platforms. Through these partnerships, banks can obtain an in-depth history of suppliers' trade volumes and a range of non-financial factors that allow the bank to assess SMEs' creditworthiness without traditional documentation. For example, DBS Bank has collaborated with Infor Nexus to co-create a digital, data-led financing programme for the company's clients, and this delivers trade financing quickly and efficiently. The platform helps Infor Nexus' customers get financing support from DBS, while the bank gains access to a broad network of suppliers. Leveraging such types of partnerships, DBS Bank has worked with over 300 clients and more than 9,000 suppliers to date to enhance connectivity in digital supply chain financing. A future still in flux Beyond the technological changes, there is much excitement around the potential for blockchain technologies to revolutionise trade financing, but the reality is that in the present context, simple automation will have a larger impact on documentation processes and help streamline trade finance. Generative AI can play an important role as a general-use technology that will have influences across organisations and accelerate the pace of backend office operations, similarly affecting trade finance. Increasingly, however, with a sharpening focus on the future of the planet, trade finance will become more and more closely linked with sustainable business practices. Across many sectors of industry, suppliers need to be encouraged or cajoled into moving towards cleaner, more sustainable business practices, and banks can play a major role in driving this transition through the provision of tailored sustainable trade financing. While geopolitical challenges will continue to shake up trade in the near term, expanding access to financing offers a pathway to ensuring opportunities for growth are equally spread out to companies of all sizes. The challenge for us in the financial industry is not just geopolitical or technological change but how we can adapt and respond to these shifts and provide clients with alternate flows, so that a more equitable and sustainable path to economic development can be realised.

When hockey takes Louis Leblanc and Pierre Dagenais to China Canada-US border | New rules for dogs abandoned (Edmonton) A major oilsands producer has been fined after hundreds of birds, wolves and coyotes were exposed to toxins in one of its tailings ponds. Published at 5:48 p.m. Bob Weber The Canadian Press The Alberta Energy Regulator has fined Canadian Natural Resources (CNRL) $278,000. \"CNRL's breach had a direct and seriously negative impact on wildlife,\" the regulator's report said. \"Live animals were killed and euthanized as a result of this breach. There could be no more serious impact on wildlife.\" The report says that in the spring of 2022, Canadian Natural workers discovered an island had emerged in one of its tailings ponds. While the company normally levels these islands to prevent animals from being attracted to them, it did not do so in this case. On May 21, 2022, workers discovered birds on the island. They counted 271 California gull nests and one Canada goose nest. The company notified the regulator on June 7, more than two weeks later. At that time, Canadian Natural said it had installed bird deterrents. \"These and subsequent mitigation measures were not effective in preventing animals from coming into contact with a hazardous substance,\" the regulator's report said. By mid-July, workers were noticing oil-soaked gull chicks. The situation continued until August 4, when the surviving chicks were able to fly away. Canadian Natural reported 411 dead birds in or near the tailings site during the entire incident. Coyotes and wolves may have also visited the island. \"The predators were able to cross the water and enter the island,\" the report said. \"CNRL acknowledged that the predators were walking in the water and killing the oiled birds.\" The regulator reduced the possible fine because the company eventually installed a fence to keep predators off the island and chicks out of the water. Canadian Natural spokeswoman Julie Woo said in an email that the company regrets the situation. \"We have applied the lessons learned to mitigate the risk of recidivism,\" she said. \"We are currently reviewing the enforcement decision. [du regulateur] and potential responses.\" M me Woo did not indicate whether the island was still there. The tailings ponds, which together cover more than 300 square kilometres, lie on a major bird migration route, and measures to keep birds away from toxic water bodies are a condition of licence for all oil sands producers. These measures are not always successful. In the most recent case, 32 waterfowl died in a Suncor pond in May 2023. The heaviest toll occurred in 2008, when 1,600 ducks died after landing in a Syncrude pond. source site-61",

It did not provide the volumes. Russia is a part of the GECF, sometimes dubbed the \"gas OPEC\", which accounts for more than two thirds of global natural gas reserves. Advertisement: The National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC) NGC's HSSE strategy is reflective and supportive of the organisational vision to become a leader in the global energy business. ngc.co.tt GECF said pipeline gas imports by the EU from Russia and Azerbaijan have been higher in each month of 2024, compared with the corresponding months in 2023. Russian pipeline gas exports plummeted to Europe to a post-Soviet lows last year after Moscow's relations with the West reached its rock bottom since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis over the conflict in Ukraine. Russia supplied a total of about 63.8 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas to Europe by various pipelines in 2022, according to Reuters calculations. The volume decreased further, by 55.6%, to 28.3 bcm last year. At their peak in 2018-19, annual flows to the region reached between 175 bcm and 180 bcm. According to Reuters calculations, Russian energy giant Gazprom's GAZP.MM average daily natural gas supplies to Europe jumped by almost 23% in June from a year earlier to 81.8 million cubic metres, rebounding from last year's post-Soviet lows, although they fell 8.6% from May. Russian pipeline gas supplies have been closely watched in recent months as Moscow's five-year gas transit deal with Ukraine expires after Dec. 31. While Russia has signalled it was willing to continue with the transit, Ukraine has said it would not renew the agreement with Moscow.

Skip to main content Advertisement Home Special reports 02 Jul 24 Rystad Energy: Bullish market fundamentals are the main contributing factor to higher global oil prices Advertisement Here is Rystad Energy's oil macro update from Global Market Analysis Director Claudio Galimberti: \"Strong market fundamentals are pushing oil prices higher this week, on track for four consecutive weeks of increases. Lower crude exports from OPEC and Russia, just as refinery runs ramp up for the summer peak, are helping contribute to a tighter-than-expected market, and prices are reacting accordingly. Increasingly likely interest rates cuts by the Fed in coming months and still high geopolitical risk premium are adding to the upward pressure.\" Better-than-expected market fundamentals and expectations of forthcoming interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve are helping keep oil prices on a bullish trajectory this week.Rystad Energy modelling suggests most of the price increases have been driven by bullish fundamentals, specifically on the refining and crude side, while macroeconomic factors and ongoing concerns regarding the escalation of conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine have played a secondary, albeit non-negligible, role.Brent prices increased by more than 6% in June, and July is starting on a similar path.Looking at the fundamentals, we have significantly lowered our forecast for US oil production from August onwards.These adjustments reflect a downturn in Permian oil output due to ongoing low activity and consolidation through mergers and acquisitions.Most changes are concentrated on the Texas side, while New Mexico has shown resilience, although April data reflects a decline in monthly figures, averaging a fall of approximately 80 000 bpd. Overall, the downward adjustment from August 2024 through December 2025 averages about 200 000 bpd.These adjustments are bullish for Brent prices and support a narrowing of the WTI-Brent spread.It should help provide some relief for OPEC+, given the production cuts they have implemented and the planned unwinding of the voluntary reductions starting in October, for the following 12 months.Recent reports suggest OPEC+ crude exports declined in June versus May, but the latest official data showed steady exports from the Middle East and declining exports from Russia in May.If crude exports from OPEC - after accounting for changes in crude burns and refinery runs - are confirmed to have declined by somewhere between 3% and 4% in June, then that may point to greater compliance by OPEC members. However, that is still speculative.Russia's seaborne crude flows in the week to 23 June appear to have dropped by 0.66 million bpd, to the lowest in more than three months.The combined effect of lower crude exports from OPEC and Russia, right at the time when global refinery runs are expected to further rump up - from 83.1 million bpd in June to 84.4 in August - would explain the tighter crude market and the surge in Brent prices over the past three weeks.On macroeconomics, the latest data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) showed that US inflation, measured by the personal consumption expenditures (CPE) index, eased further to 2.6% year on year in May, matching expectations. The core PCE, excluding food and fuel prices, also decreased to 2.6%, the lowest since March 2021.These figures are pivotal for the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate-setting decision on 31 July, with markets anticipating at least two quarter-point rate cuts this year, potentially starting in September. Despite the encouraging inflation data, a September cut remains uncertain as the pace of decline remains slow, which may be perceived as too gradual. On the political front, the US Presidential debate on Thursday night has dominated the airwaves.Early policy indications suggest either candidate would favour protectionist measures and large budget deficits if elected.This isn't good news for inflation, as both stances are inflationary.Energy-specific messaging was hard to identify in the debate, but it's safe to assume that a Trump administration would be pro-deregulation while Biden would continue to push policies aimed at advancing the green transition. In Europe, French President Emmanuel Macron's decision to call snap elections for the National Assembly backfired on Sunday as the National Rally party won by a significant margin in the first round of voting. Macron took a huge risk, but with the second round of voting this coming weekend, the exact fallout is still unclear.The second round of voting on 7 July will be pivotal for France's political stability and its leadership within the EU and the transatlantic community during this critical period.

    "Content": "Dangote Refinery: Crude oil supply options - Blueprint Newspapers Limited Skip to content The international corporations drilling oil in Nigeria are the country's greatest enemies. They have never hidden their condescension for Nigeria even as they are allowed to operate the industry on their own terms. In fact, the IOCs are partially responsible for Nigeria's total dependence on imported refined petroleum products.The international oil companies (IOCs) are compelled to operate refineries in most of the countries they drill oil. In Nigeria they defiantly snubbed the federal government's directives that they should establish refineries. Their excuse was that no refinery could succeed in Nigeria because the federal government stands around to fix unacceptable pump prices for refined petroleum products.Aliko Dangote, president of the Dangote Group, and some development banks in the international money market came together to prove that the treacherous oil firms exploiting crude oil in Nigeria were telling transparent lies when they refused to establish refineries in Nigeria on the grounds that the pump prices of refined petroleum products were controlled by the federal government. The international money market advanced loans close to $9 billion to Dangote for the establishment of what is now acknowledged as one of the world's largest refineries.No one would advance such a colossal sum as a loan for a venture known to have no means of repaying the loan. The fact that the international development banks were willing to fund Dangote Refinery is a clear indication that the venture was viable and could not be bugged down by government regulation of the pump prices of refined petroleum products.The lies of the IOCs were exposed by the success in sourcing for funds to build a giant refinery in Nigeria.The mischievous oil firms were disgraced as their lies were exposed. They gnashed their teeth and proceeded to wait for Dangote and the Nigerian people down the road.The refinery they were determined to truncate came on stream in January 2024 and in apparent frustration they drew up fresh plans to sabotage the business of the refinery and keep Nigeria as a perpetual importer of refined petroleum products.They know that if Dangote Refinery succeeds, the refineries in Europe that were supplying refined petroleum products to Nigeria at a catastrophic cost of well over $20 billion annually could be out of businessThey decided to use the last weapon in their armoury to frustrate Dangote Refinery. They defiantly refused to sell crude oil to Dangote. Those who reluctantly offer to sell the feedstock put their price tag at $6 above what obtains in the international market.Consequently, Dangote has been compelled to import crude oil for his refinery from the United States of America (USA) when Nigeria remains the highest producer of crude oil in Africa.The treacherous international oil companies operating in Nigeria have finally held Dangote Refinery and the Nigerian people in the jugular.Diesel from Dangote Refinery is more expensive than the high sulfur diesels imported by independent petroleum marketers from Europe into Nigeria.The most painful aspect of the sabotage by the IOCs is that the regulator of the industry sees nothing wrong with collaborating with foreigners to frustrate a Nigerian venture designed to ease the merciless grip of European petroleum refiners on Nigerians.The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) apathetically issues licences to independent petroleum marketers to import diesel from Europe with a weak naira and torment Nigerian consumers with high energy cost that escalates the country's catastrophic inflationary trend.When newsmen confronted the agency on the illogicality of encouraging diesel imports when a Nigerian refinery is ready to supply, NMDPRA retorted that in a deregulated market, marketers are free to source diesel from anywhere.NMDPRA is the regulatory arm of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL). The company is more or less an appendage of the mischievous international oil companies battling to protect the interest of European crude oil refiners patronised by NNPCL.NNPCL, as industry regulator, could order the deceitful IOCs to sell crude oil to Dangote Refinery at international market price. But it could only do so to the detriment of its own selfish interest.NNPCL would lose trillions of naira if Dangote Refinery gets crude oil from Nigeria and sells refined petroleum products locally at reduced pump prices.That would mean the end of the petrol subsidy scandal through which the company rakes in trillions of naira annually. That explains why NNPCL allows foreign exploiters to frustrate Dangote Refinery.NNPCL has unrestrained powers to supply crude oil to Dangote Refinery which at the moment is the only way to ease the asphyxiating hold of high energy cost on Nigeria's economy.If the treacherous IOCs defy NNPCL's directive to supply crude oil to Dangote Refinery at international market rate, the company could do the job by itself.NNPCL allocates 445,000 barrels of crude oil daily to Nigeria's moribund refineries. Nigeria's four refineries have not refined a barrel of crude oil in the last three years.Consequently, NNPCL exports the 445,000 barrels of crude oil daily to foreign refineries that feed Nigeria with refined petroleum products in return. If NNPCL reroutes the crude oil to Dangote Refinery, Nigeria would benefit extensively.The foreign refineries use the residue of the crude oil supplied by NNPCL for their petrochemical products and export them to Nigeria. If Dangote Refinery gets the crude oil, the residue would be used to produce resins that would be used to ease the escalating cost of producing plastic containers in the soft drink and brewery industries.Besides, NNPCL owes Dangote Refinery the sum of $1.7 billion as part of the 20 per cent equity it bought. It was expected to pay back with 300,000 barrels of crude oil daily. Its refusal to supply borders on betrayal of trust.It is rather saddening that Mele Kyari, the man who navigated NNPCL through the horrendous petrol subsidy scandal and crude oil theft, is still its group managing director. The man should do the right thing.

We have declared war on the challenges affecting our crude oil production. War means war. We have the right tools. We know what to fight. We know what we have to do at the level of assets. We have engaged our partners. And we will work together to improve the situation,\" the GCEO declared.According to him, a detailed analysis of assets revealed that Nigeria can conveniently produce two million barrels of crude oil per day without deploying new rigs, but the major impediment to achieving that remains the inability of players to act in a timely manner. He said the \"war\" will help NNPC Ltd. and its partners to speedily clear all identified obstacles to effective and efficient production such as delays in procurement processes, which have become a challenge in the industry. On medium to long-term measures aimed at boosting and sustaining production, Kyari said NNPC Ltd. would replace all the old crude oil pipelines built over four decades ago and also introduce a rig sharing programme with its partners to ensure that production rigs stay in the country for between four and five years which is the standard practice in most climes.He called on all players in the industry to collaborate towards reducing the cost of production and boosting production to target levels.He expressed the Company's commitment to investing in critical midstream gas infrastructure such as the Obiafu-Obrikom-Oben (OB3) and the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano gas pipelines to boost domestic gas production and supply for power generation, industrial development and economic prosperity of the country. On Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Kyari observed that NNPC Ltd. has since keyed into the Presidential CNG drive, adding that in conjunction with partners such as NIPCO Gas, NNPC Ltd. has built a number of CNG stations, 12 of which will be commissioned on Thursday in Lagos and Abuja.The opening ceremony of the NOG Energy Week also saw goodwill messages and keynotes presented by the Secretary General of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Haitham Al Ghais; Secretary General of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), Engr.

NNPC Ltd. is the Principal Sponsor of 2024 NOG Energy Week Conference & Exhibition which has as its theme \"showcasing opportunities, driving investment and meeting energy demand.\" However, with Nigeria's oil production lagging significantly behind OPEC oil production quota, the Minister for State Petroleum Resources (Oil), Senator Heineken Lokpobiri has expressed the Federal Government's determination to improve production in the coming months. The Minister stated this when he gave his ministerial address at the ongoing 2024 NOG week Lokpobiri emphasized Nigeria's commitment to increasing oil production, adding that while Nigeria \"is not in a rush to transition away from oil, the country is actively seeking to enhance its production capabilities\". According to him, \"We are focused on ramping up our oil production . When we came to office the president was concerned in increasing production in every way. I can confidently tell you that most of the deals like Seplat -ExxonMobil deal and other issues like Malabu deal are being resolved. He highlighted the benefits of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which provides a robust legal framework that guarantees returns on investments and has significantly reshaped the oil and gas sector. \"The PIA ensures a secure and profitable investment climate, making Nigeria an attractive location for investors,\" he noted. .IPPG laments delays in concluding IOCs' divestment transactions The Independent Petroleum Producers Group (IPPG) has expressed concerns over the continuos delays in concluding ongoing divestment transactions by the international oil companies (IOCs). Chairman of IPPG, Mr. Abdulrazaq Isa, raised his members' concerns yesterday in Abuja at the ongoing Nigeria Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week 2024, with the theme: \"Showcasing Opportunities, Driving Investment and Meeting Energy Demand\". In his industry address at the event, Isa specifically said that the long-overdrawn delays in concluding the IOCs divestment deals were costly to the Nigerian petroleum industry and extremely detrimental to the country as a whole. He appreciated President Bola Tinubu for the transformative reforms being undertaken by his administratio, pointing out specifically that the recent presidential executive orders and directives were a welcome development for the industry. \"Also of note is His Excellency's direct intervention in untangling issues in some of the long-overdrawn IOC divestment transactions - these delays have been costly to the industry and extremely detrimental to the nation as a whole. \"We are encouraged to see swift progress on implementation and some tangible results within a relatively short period of time. \"Such progressive and impactful policies are exactly what the industry has consistently clamoured for to sustainably develop and move the industry forward\", Isa stated. Notwithstanding those laudable policies and the gradual positive turnarounds being experienced, he maintained that the industry was in dire need of extraordinary focus to mitigate the genuine concerns on its long-term sustainability. According to him, despite Nigeria's world class hydrocarbon resource base of over 37 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves and 207 trillion cubic feet (tcf) and 600 tcf of proven and contingent gas reserves respectively, we find ourselves in a situation where our daily production has significantly dropped and lies at about 1.3 million barrels of oil and 8.5 bcf of gas today. He noted that the current oil and gas production was way below Nigeria's capacity as a nation. He added that by all globally acceptable standards, this reserves to production ratio was extremely low and a clear indicator that the industry was in a dire situation. In addition, Isa noted that \"we now run the risk of partial implementation of our national budget considering an estimated deficit of 400,000 bpd from the forecasted 1.78 million bpd. This trend in production, according to the IPPG chair, \"portends another frightening dimension when we consider that in the not-too-distant future, our overall installed domestic refining capacity, currently closing in on about 1.2 million barrels per day, may soon outstrip our current crude oil production level with the risk of Nigeria finding itself in a position where it is unable to meet its domestic refinery crude demand or even become a net importer of crude oil, God forbid! \"It is against this scary backdrop that IPPG is calling for urgent measures to be undertaken by all relevant stakeholders to immediately arrest this dwindling production level and under-investment by focusing on the following priority areas.\" On the first priority area, he called for immediate conclusion of all pending IOC divestment transactions. Isa posited that IPPG strongly advocates that their member companies such as Seplat, the Renaissance Consortium and Oando have the proven track record to successfully take over and manage those onshore and shallow water assets to realise incremental production in the region of 100,000 - 200,000 barrels of oil and over 1.5bcf of gas per day within 24 months, and well over 500,000bpd in the long term. He maintained that IPPG believes the timely approval of these IOC divestment transactions would also be a clear signal capable of restoring global investor confidence in Nigeria in an era of competing global investment destinations in Africa and very limited access to capital. On the second priority area, Isa stressed the urgent need to address deepwater development and production in Nigeria. He said untangling issues around deepwater development, particularly in terms of competitive fiscal regime being negotiated with Shell, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil and Chevron has the potential to unlock incremental production of 700,000 bpd from this terrain in the short to medium term. Isa stated, \"Enabling deepwater development will attract significant economic benefits as Nigeria has one of the world's largest untapped deepwater resource base. \"Priority Area 3: The adoption of a national value-retention strategy: Nigeria's domestic crude oil refining and petrochemical capacity must be sustained primarily from our domestic crude oil and gas production in order to transform our country into a net exporter of refined petroleum and petrochemical products that will lay a strong foundation for the rapid industrialization of the Nigerian economy. \"It is therefore imperative to grow our daily production to 2.5 million barrels of oil and 10 bcf of gas in the near to long term to ensure we are able to meet our domestic refinery and petrochemical demands and export commitments to generate the much-needed foreign exchange earnings for macro-economic stability.\" On the fourth priority area, the IPPG boss called for the development of Nigeria's gas resources to catalyse economic growth and complement decarbonisation drive. He stressed that Nigeria's vast gas resources must be exploited with immediate focus placed on restoring production to existing installed Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) capacity and expanding production (FLNG). .We see energy demand rising by 23% by 2045 - OPEC Meanwhile, The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) says energy demand will rise by an estimated 23 per cent by 2025. OPEC says the rise will be fueled by a world economy that is expected to double in size, growing from $138 trillion dollars in 2023 to $270 trillion dollars in 2045. The OPEC Secretary-General, Haitham Al Ghais, made this known on Tuesday at the ongoing 23rd Nigerian Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week Conference and Exhibition, holding in Abuja. The conference, which holds from June 30 to July 4, has its theme as \"Showcasing Opportunities, Driving Investment, Meeting Energy Demand\". Addressing the Strategic Conference via teleconference, Al Ghais explained that it forecasted a rapidly expanding world population that would surpass 9.5 billion people. \"Why are we optimistic? Let us consider these statistics, which are based on OPEC's World Oil Outlook. \"Urbanisation alone will account for over half a billion people moving to cities around the world by 2030. \"This data tells us that the world will require all forms of energy to meet long-term energy needs. \"Oil and gas will remain the predominant fuels in the energy mix. \"In fact, oil alone will retain its share at almost 30 per cent in 2045 as world demand for oil soars to an estimated 116 million barrels per day (mb/d) by that time,\" he said. To meet this rapid and robust growth in energy consumption, he said the industry would need to boost investment levels significantly in the years to come. He said according to its research, cumulative oil-related investment requirements from 2024 until 2045 would amount to $14 trillion dollars or around $610 billion dollars on average per year. \"Securing this vital funding is essential to maintaining security of supply and avoiding unwanted volatility. \"In spite of these facts, I am certain you are aware of some recent predictions for peak demand by 2030 and calls for a discontinuation of investment in hydrocarbons,\" he said. Al Ghais further emphasised that indeed, the rush to adopt \"Net-Zero\" strategies was misguided and simply not realistic. The OPEC Secretary General said that developing countries would continue to balance priorities between developing their national economies and addressing climate change. In this regard, he pledged that OPEC and its member countries would continue to advocate for a fair process for adaptation, mitigation and means of implementation, with regard to climate finance and technology. He decried the fact that there were an estimated 675 million people with no access to basic forms of energy and 2.3 billion without access to clean cooking fuels. He tasked World leaders to unite and advocate for the necessary support and resources to make a difference in addressing this important matter. \"Looking ahead, OPEC will continue to enhance dialogue and cooperation with all of its energy partners, including in Africa,\" Al Ghais said. The Secretary-General, while commending President Bola Tinubu, appreciated Nigeria's staunch commitment to OPEC and to the Declaration of Cooperation.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries produced an average of 26.98 million barrels per day in June, marking a decrease of 80,000 barrels per day from the previous month. This slight reduction was attributed to minor cuts in production from Iraq and Nigeria. The survey indicated that Iraq and the UAE did not fully comply with the cuts agreed upon at the beginning of the year with other OPEC members. Additionally, Baghdad was unable to implement the extra production cut it had pledged to compensate for previous overproduction levels. To push crude oil prices higher, the OPEC alliance may need to enforce the committed cuts fully. However, efforts to enhance compliance have shown limited results. In June, Iraq reduced its output by 30,000 barrels per day to 4.25 million barrels per day. This reduction in exports brought the country closer to its assigned quota, but its production still exceeded the quota by approximately 250,000 barrels per day, even without considering additional \"compensatory cuts.\" Related News Bloomberg: Iraq reduced its oil production by 130,000 bpd Iraq boosts oil output by 40,000 bpd in May following OPEC decision Basrah crudes surge following global oil rise Basrah crudes surge despite global oil decline Kirkuk oil production surges to over 360,000 bpd EIA reports surge in Iraqi oil exports to the US Shafaq Live Shafaq Live English English Radio facebook Shafaq news english",

Ukraine says its drone attacks on Russia are justified because it is fighting for survival as Russia has made \"massive retaliatory\" strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure.There have been no reports of successful attacks on Russian large refineries since the Taneco plant was hit on April 2.Russia is repairing its refineries fast, despite difficulties in obtaining Western know-how.That includes Rosneft-owned Ryazan plant, which put back he CDU-4 and main CDU-6 primary oil refining units into operation, as well as Kuibyshev refinery repairing CDU-4 and Syzran's CDU-5 and previously idled for maintenance CDU-6.According to Reuters calculations, total Russian primary oil refining capacity, idled by drones, was reduced to 90,500 metric tons per day (660,000 barrels per day) from around 123,800 tons per day (907,000 bpd) previously.However, in total, Russia's cumulative primary oil refining capacity, put offline due to various outages and maintenances, is expected at 4.4 million tons in April, up from 4.1 million tons in March.The respite in Ukraine's strikes comes after criticism from the United States, the world's top energy consumer, where high fuel prices is high up on the agenda in the run up to presidential election on Nov. 5.Replying to Republican U.S. Senator Tom Cotton on why Joe Biden administration was discouraging Ukrainians from the attacks on Russia's \"war-making capabilities\", Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin told the Senate Armed Services committee last week that the attacks could harm global energy markets.\"Certainly, those attacks could have a knock-on effect in terms of the global energy situation, and ... but quite frankly, I think Ukraine is better served by going after tactical and operational targets that can directly influence the current fight,\" he said.(Reporting by Reuters; writing by Vladimir Soldatkin; editing by Guy Faulconbridge and David Evans) Up next Up next Up next Up next Latest stories HuffPost Trump Tells Reporter What He 'Wasn't Expecting' After Assassination AttemptThe former president also detailed a \"little problem\" he's had since the shooting.

Crude oil imports from Russia up by 15 per cent month-on-month, 2 per cent year-on-year By Rishi Ranjan Kala Comments Share Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppReddit READ LATER Remove See All India's crude oil imports from Russia rose to 1.97 million barrels per day (mbpd) during June 2024, the highest since July 2023, largely due to lower cargoes to China.According to data from energy intelligence firm Vortexa, imports from Russia were up by almost 15 per cent month-on-month and 2 per cent on an annual basis. Data shows that both public and private sector refiners continued to import in record quantities from Russia.Public refiners such as Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) imported 1.10 mbpd crude oil, which is also a 12-month high. The cargoes last month were higher by 6 per cent M-o-M. However, imports were down by almost 11 per cent on an annual basis. During May-July 2023, public refiners imported more than 1.2 mbpd on a monthly basis from Russia.Private refiners Reliance Industries (RIL) and Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy imported a record 871,200 barrels per day (bpd) from Russia in June 2024. The cargoes were higher by 28 per cent M-o-M and 20 per cent Y-o-Y. Also read Crude oil up as market expects demand boost during US travel season Consumption of transport fuels declines in June, after May's record high End of petrodollar? We wouldn't hold our breath Vortexa's head of APAC analysis Serena Huang told businessline , \"India's imports of Russian crude at 1.97 mbpd in June 2024 is the highest since last July. China's lower appetite of Russian crude has led to more barrels heading to India.\" Import momentum India's crude imports have remained robust at 4.62 mbpd in June, Huang said. \"We expect the country's crude imports to remain robust, with downside risks from softer refining margins due to slowing global oil demand,\" she added. While Indian refiners procured more barrels from Russia, cargoes from traditional suppliers in West Asia, such as Iraq and Saudi Arabia, declined.Crude oil imports from India's second largest supplier, Iraq, fell by 20 per cent M-o-M and by 3.5 per cent Y-o-Y to roughly 754,000 bpd in June 2024. The decline was steeper in in-bound shipments from Saudi Arabia at 36 per cent M-o-M and 46 per cent Y-o-Y to around 387,000 bpd. Some trade sources said that the higher official selling price (OSP) of its flagship medium sour grade Arab Light in June could have been a reason for the lower cargoes. Crude oil shipments from the US continued to rise for the second consecutive month in June 2024. India imported roughly 331,000 bpd from the US last month, compared to around 224,000 bpd in May 2024 and 112,000 bpd in April. Trade sources said the imports were of light sweet grade due to weak market fundamentals amid refinery outages in Europe.

Cookies are small data files. When you visit a website, the website sends the cookie to your computer. Your computer stores it in a file located inside your web browser. Cookies do not transfer viruses or malware to your computer. Because the data in a cookie does not change when it travels back and forth, it has no way to affect how your computer runs, but they act more like logs (i.e. they record user activity and remember stateful information) and they get updated every time you visit a website. We may obtain information about you by accessing cookies, sent by our website. Different types of cookies keep track of different activities. For example, session cookies are used only when a person is actively navigating a website. Once you leave the website, the session cookie disappears. ENABLE ALL COOKIES AND CLOSE Why are cookies useful? We use functional cookies to analyse how visitors use our website, as well as track and improve our website's performance and function. This allows us to provide a high-quality customer experience by quickly identifying and fixing any issues that may arise. For example, we might use cookies to keep track of which website pages are most popular and which method of linking between website pages is most effective. The latter also helps us to track if you were referred to us by another website and improve our future advertising campaigns. Another use of cookies is to store your log in sessions, meaning that when you log in to the Members Area to deposit funds, a \"session cookie\" is set so that the website remembers that you have already logged in. If the website did not set this cookie, you will be asked for your login and password on each new page as you progress through the funding process. In addition, functional cookies, for example, are used to allow us to remember your preferences and identify you as a user, ensure your information is secure and operate more reliably and efficiently. For example, cookies save you the trouble of typing in your username every time you access our trading platform, and recall your preferences, such as which language you wish to see when you log in.
