(Odessa American/Eli Hartman) COYANOSA The Waha Hub operates in semi-obscurity out here some 60 miles southwest of Odessa in Pecos County, but it is an indispensable part of the Permian Basin's natural gas industry. The Permian Basin Petroleum, Texas Oil & Gas and Texas Pipeline associations say it has also been the scene of consternation as the price of gas has sometimes gone negative in recent years. \"While there is a physical location for the Waha Hub, it is really more a hub for trading natural gas,\" PBPA President Ben Shepperd said. \"The physical network of pipelines crisscrossing the area, which includes intersections at the Waha Hub, connect production to domestic destinations including the West Coast, the Midwest and the Texas Gulf Coast as well as international destinations. \"It is vital that each of the physical assets that make up this network is monitored and protected. While this production originates domestically, it is part of the global marketplace.\" Shepperd said PBPA members are often faced with making difficult business decisions and none are tougher than those tied to the global marketplace including spot prices for production. \"We are proud of the efforts our members make in engaging in such a complex business and the planning it takes to produce this vital commodity that benefits people the world over,\" he said. \"Because of the high levels of production in the Permian Basin and the need for additional takeaway infrastructure, prices for natural gas production traded through the Waha Hub have been depressed. \"And while we all celebrated our nation's independence over the July Fourth holiday, we were not celebrating Waha pricing as we saw prices go to nearly negative $4 for a five-day period. There does not appear to be one identifiable reason for this drop, but it could be attributed to low demand over the weekend and the impacts of Hurricane Beryl, which resulted in gas storage disruption along the Gulf Coast and power outages in certain parts of the state like Houston.\" But U.S. domestic conditions might gradually be improving. The London-based OilPrice.com news website said July 6 that American natural gas storage surplus to the 5-year average of inventories had declined for a seventh consecutive week, falling to 528 billion cubic feet at the end of June on the back of robust gas-fired power demand and production cuts. \"The average value of U.S. natural gas consumption coming from the power sector rose to 45.3 BCf per day by the end of June, a whopping 14-percent higher than the same period a year ago thanks to an exceptionally hot summer,\" OilPrice.com said. \"The launch of the Mountain Valley Pipeline on July 1 has led to a recovery in natural gas output across the Appalachian Basin with production expected to jump to 35 BCf per day from the Marcellus and Utica shale plays. \"For six consecutive weeks already, hedge funds have been holding a net long position in Henry Hub futures, currently around 35,000 contracts, putting an end to extremely bearish market positioning in January-May.\" The Waha Hub has more than a dozen takeaway pipelines including four major interstate pipelines and nine Texas intrastate pipelines, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Some of those include the Trans-Pecos Pipeline, the Agua Blanca Pipeline and the Permian Highway Pipeline. TXOGA Chief Economist Dean Foreman said West Texas needs pipelines to move natural gas, a by-product of oil production, to consumer markets such as the Gulf Coast or exports to Mexico when demand seasonally decreases. \"West Texas has three natural gas storage facilities, OneOK Texas for the Felmac, Keystone and Salado fields, and New Mexico has two more for the Grama Ridge and Washington Ranch fields,\" Foreman said from Austin. \"But the industry still relies on pipeline egress to market the gas and when in-region demand drops, there historically has been excess supply in the spring of recent years.\" Foreman said natural gas spot prices turned negative at the Waha Hub on an average monthly basis in the springs of 2020, 2023 and 2024. \"These are seasonal periods when natural gas consumption eases and storage for the next winter begins,\" he said. \"It's an economic question whether the supply justifies that additional pipeline capacity be built, but this explains why West Texas has distinct characteristics as a natural gas market that differ at times from those at the Henry Hub in Louisiana.\" TPA President Thure Cannon said the Waha is an area where pipelines bring supply from the Permian Basin and other producing areas to access pipelines that take this supply to the demand centers on the West Coast, north to the Mid-Continent and east to the Texas Gulf Coast. \"Waha has evolved over time and it is continuing to grow as production increases along with the need to access markets,\" Cannon said from Austin. \"There are various pipeline headers in the area that help aggregate available supplies and deliver this supply to a market-demand-based pipeline network.\" He said several TPA member companies have assets in the area. \"As production and supply continue to grow, new market access pipelines will need to be developed,\" Cannon said. \"As far as what drives gas prices in the region, it goes back to supply and demand. \"As production grows, there is limited pipeline takeaway and local demand. In general when there is limited local demand or low demand out west, the region will see depressed prices compared with the prices on the Texas Gulf Coast. \"This usually happens in the shoulder months, March to May and October to mid-December.\" %5B%7B%22id%22%3A20%2C%22name%22%3A%22Odessa%20American%20Morning%20Headlines%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22The%20day's%20top%20stories.%22%7D%5D News, straight to your inbox!Sign up for our Odessa American Morning Headlines newsletter. Sorry, something went wrong! subscribe Congratulations! You're all set! Cannon said that has been evident in the last few weeks as high temperatures out west and 100 percent of available pipeline capacity taken helped lift gas prices. \"Periods of low demand and restricted pipeline capacity due to maintenance will usually result in heavily discounted pricing in the region,\" he said. \"It is clear that there is a great demand for a more robust pipeline network in the Waha region as well as throughout Texas so that the midstream industry can continue to deliver the vital hydrocarbons that make all our lives better.\" Like this: Like Loading...

The 40-mile pipeline transports natural gas from Whistler Pipeline's Agua Dulce Header to Cheniere's Corpus Christi Liquefaction facility in Texas. The pipeline is capable of providing approximately 1.7 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of natural gas transportation capacity to the Cheniere Corpus Christi Liquefaction facility from markets on Whistler Pipeline's Agua Dulce Header in South Texas. The receipt points in Agua Dulce provide Cheniere direct access to Permian and Eagle Ford volumes in addition to volumes sourced along the Gulf Coast. The ADCC Pipeline further enhances the natural gas infrastructure in Texas and creates an additional demand point for Permian gas. Further, the infrastructure supports U.S. LNG exports to global markets. The ADCC Pipeline is a joint venture owned 70 percent by Whistler Pipeline LLC, which is a joint venture between WhiteWater, MPLX LP, and Enbridge - and 30 percent by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cheniere Energy. WhiteWater is an Austin, Texas-based infrastructure company and operator of the Whistler Pipeline. The Whistler Pipeline is an approximately 450-mile, 42-inch intrastate pipeline that transports natural gas from the Waha Header in the Permian Basin to Agua Dulce, Texas, providing direct access to South Texas and export markets. An approximately 50-mile 36-inch lateral provides connectivity to the Midland Basin. \u00ab Arizona regulators laud largest utilities for successfully meeting higher electricity demands NREL researchers say offshore wind turbines offer path for clean hydrogen production >> Connect with Us Podcast Have an idea for our new podcast?

It did not provide the volumes. Russia is a part of the GECF, sometimes dubbed the \"gas OPEC\", which accounts for more than two thirds of global natural gas reserves. Advertisement: The National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC) NGC's HSSE strategy is reflective and supportive of the organisational vision to become a leader in the global energy business. ngc.co.tt GECF said pipeline gas imports by the EU from Russia and Azerbaijan have been higher in each month of 2024, compared with the corresponding months in 2023. Russian pipeline gas exports plummeted to Europe to a post-Soviet lows last year after Moscow's relations with the West reached its rock bottom since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis over the conflict in Ukraine. Russia supplied a total of about 63.8 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas to Europe by various pipelines in 2022, according to Reuters calculations. The volume decreased further, by 55.6%, to 28.3 bcm last year. At their peak in 2018-19, annual flows to the region reached between 175 bcm and 180 bcm. According to Reuters calculations, Russian energy giant Gazprom's GAZP.MM average daily natural gas supplies to Europe jumped by almost 23% in June from a year earlier to 81.8 million cubic metres, rebounding from last year's post-Soviet lows, although they fell 8.6% from May. Russian pipeline gas supplies have been closely watched in recent months as Moscow's five-year gas transit deal with Ukraine expires after Dec. 31. While Russia has signalled it was willing to continue with the transit, Ukraine has said it would not renew the agreement with Moscow.

The 42nd Judicial District Court in DeSoto Parish ruled that Energy Transfer could not block Williams from constructing LEG pipeline crossings under the ETC Texas Pipeline in DeSoto and Sabine parishes in northwestern Louisiana. Williams as well as DT Midstream Inc. (DTM) and Momentum Midstream LLC have accused Energy Transfer of upending industry practices for pipeline crossings. The pipeline operators have said it is an attempt by Energy Transfer to prevent competitors from transporting natural gas from the Haynesville Shale.

    "Content": "US natural gas prices fall - Markets - Business Recorder Markets Print 2024-07-04 US natural gas prices fall Reuters Published July 4, 2024 Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Comments Follow us NEW YORK: US natural gas futures held near a seven-week low on Wednesday as the market waits for direction from what should be a bullish federal report expected to show last week's storage build was smaller than usual for an eighth week in a row. That lack of price movement came despite a bullish heat wave expected to linger over much of the country through at least mid-July and a bearish rise in output so far in July versus June and the tremendous oversupply of gas still in storage. The heat wave should prompt power generators to continue burning lots of gas to produce electricity to keep air conditioners humming. Traders said recent storage builds have been smaller than usual because several producers cut output earlier in the year after futures prices dropped to 3-1/2-year lows in February and March. Higher prices in recent weeks, however, prompted some producers, including EQT and Chesapeake Energy, to return to the well pad. Analysts forecast US utilities added 32 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas into storage during the week ended June 28. That compares with an increase of 76 bcf in the same week last year and a five-year (2019-2023) average rise of 69 bcf for this time of year. If correct, that will leave about 19% more gas in storage than normal at this time of year. Front-month gas futures for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 0.8 cents, or 0.3%, to $2.443 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 8:45 a.m. EDT (1245 GMT). On Tuesday, the contract closed at its lowest since May 15 for a second day in a row. Recent declines in the front-month caused futures for September, which usually trade at a discount to August, to jump to a record premium of around 2.9 cents per mmBtu over the August contract. In the spot market, next-day gas prices at the Waha hub in West Texas plunged from a negative 52 cents per mmBtu for Tuesday to negative $2.06 for Wednesday as pipeline constraints trapped gas in the Permian Shale. It was the fourth time in seven days that Waha prices fell into negative territory during the current heat wave and the 21st time so far this year. Next-day Waha prices first averaged below zero in 2019. It happened 17 times in 2019, six in 2020, none in 2021 or 2022, and once in 2023. Financial firm LSEG said gas output in the Lower 48 US states rose to an average of 101.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in July. US natural gas Comments Comments are closed.

Expand Here's the latest: August Nymex natural gas futures down 12.3 cents to $2.478/MMBtu as of 2:40 p.m. ET Lower 48 gas production rose to 102 Bcf/d on Sunday, the highest level since March 11, Wood Mackenzie data show Category 4 Hurricane Beryl is tracking to cross Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, potentially avoiding a direct strike on the Lower 48 The August contract started to trade below $2.500/MMBtu before 11 a.m. ET before bouncing on either side of the closely watched level into midday. \"Critical support sits at $2.50,\" EBW Analytics Group analyst Eli Rubin said. Forecasting from DTN shed 6.5 cooling degree days (CDD) from its Lower 48 forecasts over the next three weeks since Friday, equating to 10.4 Bcf lower demand, Rubin said. Maxar's Weather Desk also pointed to cooler temperatures. However, NatGasWeather painted a more mixed picture with weekend updates both shedding and adding modest amounts of CDD in the American and European weather models. Both forecasts continued to point to the hottest first half of July of the past 50 years, however, both models have tended to overestimate summer's heat \"and the expectation is they are doing so again this summer,\" NatGasWeather said. Wood Mackenzie estimated Lower 48 gas production fell to 100.0 Bcf/d on Monday, but analysts expected that number to be revised higher in later cycles because of volatility at the start of the month. Freeport LNG terminal's Train 2 was down about 15 hours from Saturday to Sunday, but flows have bounced back on Monday Cheniere Energy Inc.'s Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas export facility may have completed a round of maintenance U.S. LNG feed gas demand climbed to about 12.9 Bcf/d for Monday, highest since last Sunday, according to NGI's U.S. LNG Export Tracker Freeport staff told Texas officials that the facility's Train 2 tripped because of compressor issues. Feed gas flows fell to about 1.6 Bcf/d Saturday and 1.3 Bcf/d Sunday, NGI data show. On Monday, service regained its earlier June pace with nominations at around 1.9 Bcf/d. Kpler has a ship in berth loading and more scheduled through the week. Meanwhile, an uptick in feed gas flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend hints at the terminal wrapping up its traditional June maintenance. Flows to Sabine Pass over the weekend topped out above 4.3 Bcf on Sunday and were scheduled to be around 4.2 Bcf on Monday, NGI data show. \"The terminal could likely run a bit higher, with optimal summer flows near 4.4 Bcf/d,\" Criterion Research Inc.'s James Bevan, vice president of Research, said on online energy platform Enelyst. Elsewhere, flows to Cheniere's Corpus Christi and Sempra Infrastructure's Cameron LNG terminals were stable at about 2.3 Bcf/d and 1.9 Bcf/d, respectively, NGI data show. NGI modeling 29 Bcf injection into Lower 48 storage for week ending June 28 A print in-line with NGI's estimate for this week's U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report would further eat into the Lower 48's lofty storage surplus. Last week's report showed working gas in underground storage stood at 528 Bcf, or a nearly 21% surplus to the five-year average. All but eight of the last 10 weekly injections have lagged the five-year average, narrowing the surplus from 37% in mid-April. For the week ending June 28, the five-year average is an injection of 69 Bcf, while the year-earlier period saw an 76 Bcf increase. Henry Hub spot prices lower at $2.205, down 18.5 cents, NGI's MidDay Price Alert data show Southeast weaker on cooler forecasts, West Texas prices stay negative Waha rose 8.5 cents to negative $2.035 on Monday, according to NGI's MidDay Price Alert. Transco Zone 5 in the Southeast shed 25.5 cents to average $2.560, as forecasts for the region turned cooler. Weather model runs on Monday pulled Southeast forecasts for the next 10 days below normal while the 11- to 15-day outlook is only now marginally above normal, Bevan said. The cooler look resulted in a demand loss of around 9 Bcf for the region, stacking onto losses from Thursday and Friday, Bevan said. Also likely impacting prices in the Southeast is supply from the Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC (MVP), which officially began firm transport service on Monday. The new pipeline is scheduled to deliver its highest volume yet to the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Co. (aka Transco) on Monday at around 0.97 Bcf/d, or nearly half its capacity, according to Wood Mackenzie flow data. Transco's Station 160 in North Carolina, which is south of the mainline's interconnect with MVP, showed southbound flows into the Southeast rose above 2 Bcf/d Monday, setting a new high for 2024, Bevan said.

Here are the instructions how to enable JavaScript in your web browser. Skip to main content Advertisement Home Special reports 02 Jul 24 Rystad Energy: Bullish market fundamentals are the main contributing factor to higher global oil prices Advertisement Here is Rystad Energy's oil macro update from Global Market Analysis Director Claudio Galimberti: \"Strong market fundamentals are pushing oil prices higher this week, on track for four consecutive weeks of increases. Lower crude exports from OPEC and Russia, just as refinery runs ramp up for the summer peak, are helping contribute to a tighter-than-expected market, and prices are reacting accordingly. Increasingly likely interest rates cuts by the Fed in coming months and still high geopolitical risk premium are adding to the upward pressure.\" Better-than-expected market fundamentals and expectations of forthcoming interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve are helping keep oil prices on a bullish trajectory this week.Rystad Energy modelling suggests most of the price increases have been driven by bullish fundamentals, specifically on the refining and crude side, while macroeconomic factors and ongoing concerns regarding the escalation of conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine have played a secondary, albeit non-negligible, role.Brent prices increased by more than 6% in June, and July is starting on a similar path.Looking at the fundamentals, we have significantly lowered our forecast for US oil production from August onwards.These adjustments reflect a downturn in Permian oil output due to ongoing low activity and consolidation through mergers and acquisitions.Most changes are concentrated on the Texas side, while New Mexico has shown resilience, although April data reflects a decline in monthly figures, averaging a fall of approximately 80 000 bpd. Overall, the downward adjustment from August 2024 through December 2025 averages about 200 000 bpd.These adjustments are bullish for Brent prices and support a narrowing of the WTI-Brent spread.It should help provide some relief for OPEC+, given the production cuts they have implemented and the planned unwinding of the voluntary reductions starting in October, for the following 12 months.Recent reports suggest OPEC+ crude exports declined in June versus May, but the latest official data showed steady exports from the Middle East and declining exports from Russia in May.If crude exports from OPEC - after accounting for changes in crude burns and refinery runs - are confirmed to have declined by somewhere between 3% and 4% in June, then that may point to greater compliance by OPEC members. However, that is still speculative.Russia's seaborne crude flows in the week to 23 June appear to have dropped by 0.66 million bpd, to the lowest in more than three months.The combined effect of lower crude exports from OPEC and Russia, right at the time when global refinery runs are expected to further rump up - from 83.1 million bpd in June to 84.4 in August - would explain the tighter crude market and the surge in Brent prices over the past three weeks.On macroeconomics, the latest data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) showed that US inflation, measured by the personal consumption expenditures (CPE) index, eased further to 2.6% year on year in May, matching expectations. The core PCE, excluding food and fuel prices, also decreased to 2.6%, the lowest since March 2021.These figures are pivotal for the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate-setting decision on 31 July, with markets anticipating at least two quarter-point rate cuts this year, potentially starting in September. Despite the encouraging inflation data, a September cut remains uncertain as the pace of decline remains slow, which may be perceived as too gradual. On the political front, the US Presidential debate on Thursday night has dominated the airwaves.Early policy indications suggest either candidate would favour protectionist measures and large budget deficits if elected.This isn't good news for inflation, as both stances are inflationary.Energy-specific messaging was hard to identify in the debate, but it's safe to assume that a Trump administration would be pro-deregulation while Biden would continue to push policies aimed at advancing the green transition. In Europe, French President Emmanuel Macron's decision to call snap elections for the National Assembly backfired on Sunday as the National Rally party won by a significant margin in the first round of voting. Macron took a huge risk, but with the second round of voting this coming weekend, the exact fallout is still unclear.The second round of voting on 7 July will be pivotal for France's political stability and its leadership within the EU and the transatlantic community during this critical period.

After marching across the Yucatan, the NHC projected Beryl will weaken into a tropical storm by the time it enters the Bay of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico, where Mexico produces much of its oil, on Saturday before approaching the Texas-Mexico border on Sunday. SUPPLY AND DEMAND Financial firm LSEG said gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states rose to an average of 101.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in July. That was up from an average of 100.1 bcfd in June and a 17-month low of 99.5 bcfd in May as many producers reduced drilling activities after prices fell to 3-1/2-year lows in February and March. U.S. output hit a monthly record high of 105.5 bcfd in December 2023. Meteorologists projected weather across the Lower 48 states would remain hotter than normal through at least July 17. With hotter weather expected next week, LSEG forecast average gas demand in the Lower 48, including exports, will rise from 98.5 bcfd this week to 104.5 bcfd next week. Those forecasts were lower than LSEG's outlook on Monday. Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants fell to 12.2 bcfd so far in July, down from 12.8 bcfd in June and a monthly record high of 14.7 bcfd in December 2023. That decline was due mostly to an expected drop in feedgas at Cheniere Energy's 4.5-bcfd Sabine Pass in Louisiana to a one-week low of 3.7 bcfd on Tuesday, down from 4.1 bcfd on Monday and an average of 4.0 bcfd over the prior seven days.

State oil company Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos (Pemex) produced 3.65 Bcf/d, or 95% of total gas output last month, with private sector operators accounting for the remainder, according to upstream regulator Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Hidrocarburos (CNH). The top five gas producing fields, all operated by Pemex, were Quesqui (570 MMcf/d), Ixachi (507 MMcf/d), Akal (355 MMcf/d), Maloob (138 MMcf/d) and Onel (133 MMcf/d). Associated gas tied to oil production averaged 1.99 Bcf/d, versus 1.86 Bcf/d for non-associated gas. The International Energy Agency is forecasting a major decline in oil supply from Mexico between 2024 and 2030 due to underinvestment in exploration and production (E&P). President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum has signaled her intent to continue the energy policies of her predecessor Andres Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who has sought to solidify Pemex's dominant role in E&P. Sheinbaum on Thursday (June 27) named economist Luz Elena Gonz\u00e1lez Escobar to be the country's next energy secretary. Gonz\u00e1lez Escobar said she would pursue \"an energy policy that will continue to guarantee national sovereignty and will at the same time advance the energy transition.\" L\u00f3pez Obrador and Sheinbaum also both officially oppose hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in Mexico, despite the country's substantial prospective resources of unconventional natural gas. In a June 20 speech, CNH Chairman Agust\u00edn D\u00edaz Lastra - a L\u00f3pez Obrador appointee - said that exploration work should continue so that unconventional prospective resources could be reclassified as reserves. This would allow unconventional projects to be developed more quickly if fracking is authorized, D\u00edaz indicated. Upon taking office in 2018, L\u00f3pez Obrador canceled bid rounds that would have made onshore unconventional gas blocks available for exploration. Meanwhile, gas imports from the United States have accounted for 6.37 Bcf/d, or 72% of Mexico's total gas supply this year through June 19, up 536 MMcf/d from the same period last year, Wood Mackenzie data show. The country's overall gas demand over the same span was down 120 MMcf/d to 8.52 Bcf/d, with only the power sector showing a year/year increase in consumption. Domestic production has accounted for 2.38 Bcf/d, or 27% of Mexican gas supply this year, according to the consultancy. Pemex has consumed 1.56 Bcf/d for its own operations, including enhanced oil recovery and refining. Pemex, for its part, reported a third straight sequential decline in dry gas production from its processing centers to 1.8 Bcf/d in May. Mexico natural gas prices closely track those of the United States due to Mexico's reliance on U.S. imports. Mexico's IPGN monthly natural gas price index averaged $1.922/MMBtu in May 2024, down from $3.159 in May 2023. After slumping below $2.00for much of 2024 so far, Lower 48 natural gas prices have strengthened some with summer underway. NGI's daily Henry Hub spot price averaged $2.390 on Friday.

The spokesperson also said that it was agreed that 21 liquefied natural gas cargos are to arrive in Egypt during the summer, in addition to shipments of mazut fuel.

In June, Egypt fully awarded 20 cargoes of LNG in its biggest purchase of the seaborne fuel, aimed to cover heavy summer demand from July through September. Supplies of the natural gas that helps Egypt generate electricity have been dwindling at a time when an expanding population and urban development have been pushing up electricity demand. When temperatures rise, air conditioning use drives up power consumption. Egypt needs to import around $1.18 billion worth of natural gas and mazut fuel oil to end persistent power cuts exacerbated by consecutive heatwaves, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said last month.

We have declared war on the challenges affecting our crude oil production. War means war. We have the right tools. We know what to fight. We know what we have to do at the level of assets. We have engaged our partners. And we will work together to improve the situation,\" the GCEO declared.According to him, a detailed analysis of assets revealed that Nigeria can conveniently produce two million barrels of crude oil per day without deploying new rigs, but the major impediment to achieving that remains the inability of players to act in a timely manner. He said the \"war\" will help NNPC Ltd. and its partners to speedily clear all identified obstacles to effective and efficient production such as delays in procurement processes, which have become a challenge in the industry. On medium to long-term measures aimed at boosting and sustaining production, Kyari said NNPC Ltd. would replace all the old crude oil pipelines built over four decades ago and also introduce a rig sharing programme with its partners to ensure that production rigs stay in the country for between four and five years which is the standard practice in most climes.He called on all players in the industry to collaborate towards reducing the cost of production and boosting production to target levels.He expressed the Company's commitment to investing in critical midstream gas infrastructure such as the Obiafu-Obrikom-Oben (OB3) and the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano gas pipelines to boost domestic gas production and supply for power generation, industrial development and economic prosperity of the country. On Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Kyari observed that NNPC Ltd. has since keyed into the Presidential CNG drive, adding that in conjunction with partners such as NIPCO Gas, NNPC Ltd. has built a number of CNG stations, 12 of which will be commissioned on Thursday in Lagos and Abuja.The opening ceremony of the NOG Energy Week also saw goodwill messages and keynotes presented by the Secretary General of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Haitham Al Ghais; Secretary General of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), Engr.

Group Chief Executive Officer of NNPC Ltd, Mr. Mele Kyari, disclosed this in a keynote address at the opening ceremony of the 23rd edition of the Nigeria Oil & Gas Conference and Exhibition (NOG Energy Week) in Abuja, on Tuesday. \"We have decided to stop the debate. We have declared war on the challenges affecting our crude oil production. War means war. We have the right tools. We know what to fight. We know what we have to do at the level of assets. We have engaged our partners. And we will work together to improve the situation,\" the GCEO declared. According to him, a detailed analysis of assets revealed that Nigeria can conveniently produce two million barrels of crude oil per day without deploying new rigs, but the major impediment to achieving that remains the inability of players to act in a timely manner. He said the \"war\" will help NNPC Ltd. and its partners to speedily clear all identified obstacles to effective and efficient production such as delays in procurement processes, which have become a challenge in the industry. On medium to long-term measures aimed at boosting and sustaining production, Kyari said NNPC Ltd. would replace all the old crude oil pipelines built over four decades ago and also introduce a rig sharing programme with its partners to ensure that production rigs stay in the country for between four and five years which is the standard practice in most climes. He called on all players in the industry to collaborate towards reducing the cost of production and boosting production to target levels. He expressed the Company's commitment to investing in critical midstream gas infrastructure such as the Obiafu-Obrikom-Oben (OB3) and the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano gas pipelines to boost domestic gas production and supply for power generation, industrial development and economic prosperity of the country. On Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Kyari observed that NNPC Ltd. has since keyed into the Presidential CNG drive, adding that in conjunction with partners such as NIPCO Gas, NNPC Ltd. has built a number of CNG stations, 12 of which will be commissioned on Thursday in Lagos and Abuja. NNPC Ltd. is the Principal Sponsor of 2024 NOG Energy Week Conference & Exhibition which has as its theme \"showcasing opportunities, driving investment and meeting energy demand.\" However, with Nigeria's oil production lagging significantly behind OPEC oil production quota, the Minister for State Petroleum Resources (Oil), Senator Heineken Lokpobiri has expressed the Federal Government's determination to improve production in the coming months. The Minister stated this when he gave his ministerial address at the ongoing 2024 NOG week Lokpobiri emphasized Nigeria's commitment to increasing oil production, adding that while Nigeria \"is not in a rush to transition away from oil, the country is actively seeking to enhance its production capabilities\". According to him, \"We are focused on ramping up our oil production . When we came to office the president was concerned in increasing production in every way. I can confidently tell you that most of the deals like Seplat -ExxonMobil deal and other issues like Malabu deal are being resolved. He highlighted the benefits of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which provides a robust legal framework that guarantees returns on investments and has significantly reshaped the oil and gas sector. \"The PIA ensures a secure and profitable investment climate, making Nigeria an attractive location for investors,\" he noted. .IPPG laments delays in concluding IOCs' divestment transactions The Independent Petroleum Producers Group (IPPG) has expressed concerns over the continuos delays in concluding ongoing divestment transactions by the international oil companies (IOCs). Chairman of IPPG, Mr. Abdulrazaq Isa, raised his members' concerns yesterday in Abuja at the ongoing Nigeria Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week 2024, with the theme: \"Showcasing Opportunities, Driving Investment and Meeting Energy Demand\". In his industry address at the event, Isa specifically said that the long-overdrawn delays in concluding the IOCs divestment deals were costly to the Nigerian petroleum industry and extremely detrimental to the country as a whole. He appreciated President Bola Tinubu for the transformative reforms being undertaken by his administratio, pointing out specifically that the recent presidential executive orders and directives were a welcome development for the industry. \"Also of note is His Excellency's direct intervention in untangling issues in some of the long-overdrawn IOC divestment transactions - these delays have been costly to the industry and extremely detrimental to the nation as a whole. \"We are encouraged to see swift progress on implementation and some tangible results within a relatively short period of time. \"Such progressive and impactful policies are exactly what the industry has consistently clamoured for to sustainably develop and move the industry forward\", Isa stated. Notwithstanding those laudable policies and the gradual positive turnarounds being experienced, he maintained that the industry was in dire need of extraordinary focus to mitigate the genuine concerns on its long-term sustainability. According to him, despite Nigeria's world class hydrocarbon resource base of over 37 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves and 207 trillion cubic feet (tcf) and 600 tcf of proven and contingent gas reserves respectively, we find ourselves in a situation where our daily production has significantly dropped and lies at about 1.3 million barrels of oil and 8.5 bcf of gas today. He noted that the current oil and gas production was way below Nigeria's capacity as a nation. He added that by all globally acceptable standards, this reserves to production ratio was extremely low and a clear indicator that the industry was in a dire situation. In addition, Isa noted that \"we now run the risk of partial implementation of our national budget considering an estimated deficit of 400,000 bpd from the forecasted 1.78 million bpd. This trend in production, according to the IPPG chair, \"portends another frightening dimension when we consider that in the not-too-distant future, our overall installed domestic refining capacity, currently closing in on about 1.2 million barrels per day, may soon outstrip our current crude oil production level with the risk of Nigeria finding itself in a position where it is unable to meet its domestic refinery crude demand or even become a net importer of crude oil, God forbid! \"It is against this scary backdrop that IPPG is calling for urgent measures to be undertaken by all relevant stakeholders to immediately arrest this dwindling production level and under-investment by focusing on the following priority areas.\" On the first priority area, he called for immediate conclusion of all pending IOC divestment transactions. Isa posited that IPPG strongly advocates that their member companies such as Seplat, the Renaissance Consortium and Oando have the proven track record to successfully take over and manage those onshore and shallow water assets to realise incremental production in the region of 100,000 - 200,000 barrels of oil and over 1.5bcf of gas per day within 24 months, and well over 500,000bpd in the long term. He maintained that IPPG believes the timely approval of these IOC divestment transactions would also be a clear signal capable of restoring global investor confidence in Nigeria in an era of competing global investment destinations in Africa and very limited access to capital. On the second priority area, Isa stressed the urgent need to address deepwater development and production in Nigeria. He said untangling issues around deepwater development, particularly in terms of competitive fiscal regime being negotiated with Shell, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil and Chevron has the potential to unlock incremental production of 700,000 bpd from this terrain in the short to medium term. Isa stated, \"Enabling deepwater development will attract significant economic benefits as Nigeria has one of the world's largest untapped deepwater resource base. \"Priority Area 3: The adoption of a national value-retention strategy: Nigeria's domestic crude oil refining and petrochemical capacity must be sustained primarily from our domestic crude oil and gas production in order to transform our country into a net exporter of refined petroleum and petrochemical products that will lay a strong foundation for the rapid industrialization of the Nigerian economy. \"It is therefore imperative to grow our daily production to 2.5 million barrels of oil and 10 bcf of gas in the near to long term to ensure we are able to meet our domestic refinery and petrochemical demands and export commitments to generate the much-needed foreign exchange earnings for macro-economic stability.\" On the fourth priority area, the IPPG boss called for the development of Nigeria's gas resources to catalyse economic growth and complement decarbonisation drive. He stressed that Nigeria's vast gas resources must be exploited with immediate focus placed on restoring production to existing installed Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) capacity and expanding production (FLNG). .We see energy demand rising by 23% by 2045 - OPEC Meanwhile, The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) says energy demand will rise by an estimated 23 per cent by 2025. OPEC says the rise will be fueled by a world economy that is expected to double in size, growing from $138 trillion dollars in 2023 to $270 trillion dollars in 2045. The OPEC Secretary-General, Haitham Al Ghais, made this known on Tuesday at the ongoing 23rd Nigerian Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week Conference and Exhibition, holding in Abuja. The conference, which holds from June 30 to July 4, has its theme as \"Showcasing Opportunities, Driving Investment, Meeting Energy Demand\". Addressing the Strategic Conference via teleconference, Al Ghais explained that it forecasted a rapidly expanding world population that would surpass 9.5 billion people. \"Why are we optimistic? Let us consider these statistics, which are based on OPEC's World Oil Outlook. \"Urbanisation alone will account for over half a billion people moving to cities around the world by 2030. \"This data tells us that the world will require all forms of energy to meet long-term energy needs. \"Oil and gas will remain the predominant fuels in the energy mix. \"In fact, oil alone will retain its share at almost 30 per cent in 2045 as world demand for oil soars to an estimated 116 million barrels per day (mb/d) by that time,\" he said. To meet this rapid and robust growth in energy consumption, he said the industry would need to boost investment levels significantly in the years to come. He said according to its research, cumulative oil-related investment requirements from 2024 until 2045 would amount to $14 trillion dollars or around $610 billion dollars on average per year. \"Securing this vital funding is essential to maintaining security of supply and avoiding unwanted volatility. \"In spite of these facts, I am certain you are aware of some recent predictions for peak demand by 2030 and calls for a discontinuation of investment in hydrocarbons,\" he said. Al Ghais further emphasised that indeed, the rush to adopt \"Net-Zero\" strategies was misguided and simply not realistic. The OPEC Secretary General said that developing countries would continue to balance priorities between developing their national economies and addressing climate change. In this regard, he pledged that OPEC and its member countries would continue to advocate for a fair process for adaptation, mitigation and means of implementation, with regard to climate finance and technology. He decried the fact that there were an estimated 675 million people with no access to basic forms of energy and 2.3 billion without access to clean cooking fuels. He tasked World leaders to unite and advocate for the necessary support and resources to make a difference in addressing this important matter. \"Looking ahead, OPEC will continue to enhance dialogue and cooperation with all of its energy partners, including in Africa,\" Al Ghais said. The Secretary-General, while commending President Bola Tinubu, appreciated Nigeria's staunch commitment to OPEC and to the Declaration of Cooperation.

Expand Ahead of the 12 p.m. ET print, the August futures contract was up 2.0 cents at $2.455/MMBtu. The prompt month ticked lower to $2.452 when the EIA data was released, a day early because of the Fourth of July holiday. About 20 minutes later, the contract stood at $2.456, up 2.1 cents from Tuesday's settlement. Prior to the report, NGI modeled a 29 Bcf build. Early estimates to Reuters ranged from builds of 13 Bcf to 76 Bcf, with an average increase of 41 Bcf. The five-year average build was 69 Bcf for the week, while a year ago it was 76 Bcf.

Expand NGI's July Bidweek National Avg. climbed 40.0 cents month/month to $2.215/MMBtu. That was down from $2.560 a year earlier. Trading for the latest bidweek period spanned June 24-26. Weather conditions proved mostly hot across the southern two-thirds of the Lower 48 in that span. National Weather Service (NWS) forecasts call for more of the same through the first half of July, with the heat spreading further to the northern third of the country. NWS outlooks also repeatedly have predicted above-average national temperatures for the summer overall. \"The weather backdrop is simply bullish,\" Pinebrook Energy Advisors' Andy Huenefeld, managing partner, told NGI during bidweek. Several natural gas hubs in California and the Southwest, where scorching temperatures were widespread over the final days of June and forecasted to sizzle further in coming weeks, propelled the overall increase during bidweek. Those regions also are dependent in part on gas from the Permian Basin, where maintenance work amid pipeline constraints in June limited supplies flowing west. SoCal Citygate surged $1.335 month/month to average $3.055, and SoCal Border Avg. jumped $1.235 to $2.565. In the Southwest, KRGT Del Pool spiked $1.150 to $2.740, while El Paso S. Mainline/N. Baja rose $1.400 to $2.600. Futures prices, however, struggled in late June as traders fixated on rising production and robust inventories of gas stored underground. Production consistently held around 100 Bcf/d late last month, rising from spring lows in the mid-90s Bcf/d, according to Wood Mackenzie. The firm on Monday estimated output at 100 Bcf/d. At the same time, supplies in storage remained abundant. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported an injection of 52 Bcf for the week ended June 21. The increase boosted inventories to 3,097 Bcf and put stocks 21% above the five-year average of 2,569 Bcf. The futures market \"is a little bit in a wait-and-see mode, wanting to actually witness the July heat develop as forecasted,\" StoneX Financial Inc.'s Thomas Saal, senior vice president of energy, told NGI. \"Because if that heat doesn't come through, we're going to be sitting on a lot of gas.\" Futures Pressure On the final day of the latest bidweek period, the July Nymex natural gas futures contract rolled off the board with a 12.8-cent loss. It settled at $2.628 on that Wednesday, down 3% from the prior week's close. It had lost ground the previous week as well. The August contract moved to the front of the curve last Thursday and fell 6.0 cents in that session and another 8.4 cents the following day. On Monday, it settled at $2.478, down 12.3 cents. \"We remain focused on rising natural gas production in mid-summer as drillers return deferred supply to the market,\" said EBW Analytics Group's Eli Rubin, senior analyst. Any \"downturn in cooling demand could send gas tumbling.\" Still, Rubin noted the forecasts point to solid demand ahead, and on the storage front, the surplus to the five-year average has narrowed over the past two months. With the latest EIA print, the surfeit declined by two percentage points. It has been cut in half since topping 40% in March. If that continues alongside scorching mid-summer conditions, he said, futures could rally. \"In the most likely scenario, record July heat may reinforce support for gas prices, whittle down storage surpluses, and allow\" the August contract \"to rebound towards $3.00 in the near-to-medium term.\" Catalysts Ahead While rising production creates a bearish undercurrent to watch closely, Rubin also noted that several new LNG facilities are in the works along the Gulf Coast that could double liquefied natural gas demand before the end of this decade. The first of them could open later this year, launching the trend. Notably, in late June, Texas Eastern Transmission LP began feeding gas to a pending Venture Global LNG Inc. export terminal through Gator Express in Louisiana. The initial test volumes to Plaquemines LNG indicated the facility was on track \"to start exporting in late 2024,\" Wood Mackenzie analyst Nadeem Ahmed said. Rubin described the testing as \"a momentous\" for Venture Global LNG. \"The speed of the near-term ramp up at Plaquemines may offer sufficient demand for natural gas to ward off oversupply later this year,\" he said. Wood Mackenzie data showed gas flows to LNG export facilities at 12.5 Bcf on Monday, up from an average of 12 Bcf/d last week. In the near term, NWS forecasts showed hotter-than-normal high temperatures from the upper 80s to 100s canvassing large swaths of the country from the Southwest to the East Coast this week. \"The first week of July marks the approximate six weeks of the year that typically bring the hottest conditions to most of the nation,\" said AccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski. \"When temperatures exceed the historical average even by a few degrees this time of the year, the heat can be dangerous.\" For the second week of July, highs from the 80s to low 90s were expected to spread over northern markets, while temperatures in the upper 80s to 100s were predicted to remain prevalent throughout southern areas. That would mark a continuation from late June. Strong heat in the final week of the month was expected to result in a seasonally light storage injection with the next EIA report on Wednesday - a day earlier than usual this week because of the Fourth of July holiday on Thursday. Preliminary injection estimates submitted to Reuters for the week ended June 28 ranged from 13 Bcf to 76 Bcf, with an average of 41 Bcf. NGI modeled a build of 29 Bcf. That compares with a five-year average increase of 69 Bcf. With those bullish factors in play, NGI's Patrick Rau, senior vice president of Research & Analysis, said Monday that futures were \"well into oversold territory now.\" However, he added, since the August contract fell below $2.50, \"there could be some follow-on selling down toward the next technical support level in the $2.40 range.\" Related Tags natural gas production weather Kevin Dobbs Kevin Dobbs joined the staff of NGI in April 2020.
