[{"Title": "Natural Gas Futures Drift Lower After Light EIA Storage Print; Cash Weaker â€” MidDay Market Snapshot - Natural Gas Intelligence","Summary": "August natural gas futures continued their decline for the seventh straight session due to a modest weekly storage build and a bearish revision to the previous week. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a seasonally light build of 32 Bcf for the week ending June 28, which contributed to the bearish sentiment. This ongoing trend indicates a potential oversupply in the market, which is crucial for ADNOC Global Trading to monitor as it affects pricing and demand dynamics."}, {"Title": "US natural gas prices fall - Markets - Business Recorder","Summary": "US natural gas futures remained near a seven-week low as the market awaited a federal report expected to show a smaller-than-usual storage build for the eighth consecutive week. Despite a bullish heat wave prompting high gas usage for electricity, higher output and substantial oversupply in storage weighed on prices. This situation reflects significant market volatility and supply-demand imbalances, which are critical for ADNOC Global Trading to consider for strategic planning and risk management."}]
