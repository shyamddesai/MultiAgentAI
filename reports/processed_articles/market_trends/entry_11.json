Oversold Natural Gas Futures Move Up in Relief Rally as Market Eyes Hurricane Impact     Daily Gas Price Index Natural Gas Prices     July 08, 2024   August natural gas futures began the week deep in oversold territory but with a clear line of sight on the next key technical support level should Hurricane Beryl cause significant demand destruction.
