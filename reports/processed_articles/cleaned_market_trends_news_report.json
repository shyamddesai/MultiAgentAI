    "Content": "       US natural gas prices fall - Markets - Business Recorder                                                                     Markets  Print 2024-07-04  US natural gas prices fall    Reuters   Published July 4, 2024       Facebook   Twitter   Whatsapp   Comments            Follow us      NEW YORK: US natural gas futures held near a seven-week low on Wednesday as the market waits for direction from what should be a bullish federal report expected to show last week's storage build was smaller than usual for an eighth week in a row.  That lack of price movement came despite a bullish heat wave expected to linger over much of the country through at least mid-July and a bearish rise in output so far in July versus June and the tremendous oversupply of gas still in storage. The heat wave should prompt power generators to continue burning lots of gas to produce electricity to keep air conditioners humming. Traders said recent storage builds have been smaller than usual because several producers cut output earlier in the year after futures prices dropped to 3-1/2-year lows in February and March. Higher prices in recent weeks, however, prompted some producers, including EQT and Chesapeake Energy, to return to the well pad. Analysts forecast US utilities added 32 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas into storage during the week ended June 28. That compares with an increase of 76 bcf in the same week last year and a five-year (2019-2023) average rise of 69 bcf for this time of year. If correct, that will leave about 19% more gas in storage than normal at this time of year. Front-month gas futures for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 0.8 cents, or 0.3%, to $2.443 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 8:45 a.m. EDT (1245 GMT). On Tuesday, the contract closed at its lowest since May 15 for a second day in a row. Recent declines in the front-month caused futures for September, which usually trade at a discount to August, to jump to a record premium of around 2.9 cents per mmBtu over the August contract. In the spot market, next-day gas prices at the Waha hub in West Texas plunged from a negative 52 cents per mmBtu for Tuesday to negative $2.06 for Wednesday as pipeline constraints trapped gas in the Permian Shale. It was the fourth time in seven days that Waha prices fell into negative territory during the current heat wave and the 21st time so far this year. Next-day Waha prices first averaged below zero in 2019. It happened 17 times in 2019, six in 2020, none in 2021 or 2022, and once in 2023. Financial firm LSEG said gas output in the Lower 48 US states rose to an average of 101.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in July.

Skip to main content         Advertisement                   Home Special reports 02 Jul 24 Rystad Energy: Bullish market fundamentals are the main contributing factor to higher global oil prices                   Advertisement        Here is Rystad Energy's oil macro update from Global Market Analysis Director Claudio Galimberti:   \"Strong market fundamentals are pushing oil prices higher this week, on track for four consecutive weeks of increases. Lower crude exports from OPEC and Russia, just as refinery runs ramp up for the summer peak, are helping contribute to a tighter-than-expected market, and prices are reacting accordingly. Increasingly likely interest rates cuts by the Fed in coming months and still high geopolitical risk premium are adding to the upward pressure.\" Better-than-expected market fundamentals and expectations of forthcoming interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve are helping keep oil prices on a bullish trajectory this week.Rystad Energy modelling suggests most of the price increases have been driven by bullish fundamentals, specifically on the refining and crude side, while macroeconomic factors and ongoing concerns regarding the escalation of conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine have played a secondary, albeit non-negligible, role.Brent prices increased by more than 6% in June, and July is starting on a similar path.Looking at the fundamentals, we have significantly lowered our forecast for US oil production from August onwards.These adjustments reflect a downturn in Permian oil output due to ongoing low activity and consolidation through mergers and acquisitions.Most changes are concentrated on the Texas side, while New Mexico has shown resilience, although April data reflects a decline in monthly figures, averaging a fall of approximately 80 000 bpd. Overall, the downward adjustment from August 2024 through December 2025 averages about 200 000 bpd.These adjustments are bullish for Brent prices and support a narrowing of the WTI-Brent spread.It should help provide some relief for OPEC+, given the production cuts they have implemented and the planned unwinding of the voluntary reductions starting in October, for the following 12 months.Recent reports suggest OPEC+ crude exports declined in June versus May, but the latest official data showed steady exports from the Middle East and declining exports from Russia in May.If crude exports from OPEC - after accounting for changes in crude burns and refinery runs - are confirmed to have declined by somewhere between 3% and 4% in June, then that may point to greater compliance by OPEC members. However, that is still speculative.Russia's seaborne crude flows in the week to 23 June appear to have dropped by 0.66 million bpd, to the lowest in more than three months.The combined effect of lower crude exports from OPEC and Russia, right at the time when global refinery runs are expected to further rump up - from 83.1 million bpd in June to 84.4 in August - would explain the tighter crude market and the surge in Brent prices over the past three weeks.On macroeconomics, the latest data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) showed that US inflation, measured by the personal consumption expenditures (CPE) index, eased further to 2.6% year on year in May, matching expectations. The core PCE, excluding food and fuel prices, also decreased to 2.6%, the lowest since March 2021.These figures are pivotal for the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate-setting decision on 31 July, with markets anticipating at least two quarter-point rate cuts this year, potentially starting in September. Despite the encouraging inflation data, a September cut remains uncertain as the pace of decline remains slow, which may be perceived as too gradual. On the political front, the US Presidential debate on Thursday night has dominated the airwaves.Early policy indications suggest either candidate would favour protectionist measures and large budget deficits if elected.This isn't good news for inflation, as both stances are inflationary.Energy-specific messaging was hard to identify in the debate, but it's safe to assume that a Trump administration would be pro-deregulation while Biden would continue to push policies aimed at advancing the green transition. In Europe, French President Emmanuel Macron's decision to call snap elections for the National Assembly backfired on Sunday as the National Rally party won by a significant margin in the first round of voting.

Front-month gas futures for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 2.4 cents, or 1.0%, to $2.454 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 8:49 a.m. EDT (1249 GMT), putting the contract on track for its lowest close since May 15 for a second day in a row.In other news, a federal judge dealt US President Joe Biden's climate agenda a setback by blocking the Democrat's administration from continuing to pause the approval of applications to export liquefied natural gas (LNG). In Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), power grid operator for most of the state, said peak demand this week will come close to but not break the record for the month of July as homes and businesses crank up their air conditioners to escape a heat wave.In the spot market, next-day gas prices at the Waha hub in West Texas plunged by about 123% to a negative 52 cents per mmBtu for Tuesday as pipeline constraints trap gas in the Permian Shale again.That is the third time in six days Waha prices fell into negative territory during the current heat wave and the 20th time so far this year. Next-day Waha prices first averaged below zero in 2019. It happened 17 times in 2019, six in 2020, none in 2021 and 2022, and once in 2023.In the Caribbean Sea, Hurricane Beryl, an extremely dangerous major hurricane, will hit Jamaica on Wednesday before slamming slam into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the latest US National Hurricane Center (NHC) outlook.

Analysts forecast there was still about 19% more gas in storage than usual for this time of year even though output reductions earlier in 2024 kept weekly injections below normal over the past seven weeks.That price decline came even though the heat wave blanketing much of the country for weeks will linger through at least mid-July, forcing power generators to continue burning lots of gas to keep air conditioners humming. Front-month gas futures for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 6.5 cents, or 2.5%, to $2.536 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 10:17 a.m. EDT (1417 GMT), putting the contract on track for its lowest close since May 29.Even though gas prices gained about 4% last week, speculators cut their net long futures and options positions on the New York Mercantile and Intercontinental Exchanges for the first time in three weeks, according to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Commitments of Traders report.In Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the power grid operator for most of the state, said peak demand came close but did not break the record for the month of June last week, as had been expected.ERCOT, however, projects demand will break the July record on Tuesday as homes and businesses crank up their air conditioners to escape the heat blanketing the state.

Skip to main content         Advertisement                   Home Business news 02 Jul 24 Rystad Energy: Bullish market fundamentals are the main contributing factor to higher global oil prices                   Advertisement        Here is Rystad Energy's oil macro update from Global Market Analysis Director Claudio Galimberti:   \"Strong market fundamentals are pushing oil prices higher this week, on track for four consecutive weeks of increases. Lower crude exports from OPEC and Russia, just as refinery runs ramp up for the summer peak, are helping contribute to a tighter-than-expected market, and prices are reacting accordingly. Increasingly likely interest rates cuts by the Fed in coming months and still high geopolitical risk premium are adding to the upward pressure.\" Better-than-expected market fundamentals and expectations of forthcoming interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve are helping keep oil prices on a bullish trajectory this week.Rystad Energy modelling suggests most of the price increases have been driven by bullish fundamentals, specifically on the refining and crude side, while macroeconomic factors and ongoing concerns regarding the escalation of conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine have played a secondary, albeit non-negligible, role.Brent prices increased by more than 6% in June, and July is starting on a similar path.Looking at the fundamentals, we have significantly lowered our forecast for US oil production from August onwards.These adjustments reflect a downturn in Permian oil output due to ongoing low activity and consolidation through mergers and acquisitions.Most changes are concentrated on the Texas side, while New Mexico has shown resilience, although April data reflects a decline in monthly figures, averaging a fall of approximately 80 000 bpd. Overall, the downward adjustment from August 2024 through December 2025 averages about 200 000 bpd.These adjustments are bullish for Brent prices and support a narrowing of the WTI-Brent spread.It should help provide some relief for OPEC+, given the production cuts they have implemented and the planned unwinding of the voluntary reductions starting in October, for the following 12 months.Recent reports suggest OPEC+ crude exports declined in June versus May, but the latest official data showed steady exports from the Middle East and declining exports from Russia in May.If crude exports from OPEC - after accounting for changes in crude burns and refinery runs - are confirmed to have declined by somewhere between 3% and 4% in June, then that may point to greater compliance by OPEC members. However, that is still speculative.Russia's seaborne crude flows in the week to 23 June appear to have dropped by 0.66 million bpd, to the lowest in more than three months.The combined effect of lower crude exports from OPEC and Russia, right at the time when global refinery runs are expected to further rump up - from 83.1 million bpd in June to 84.4 in August - would explain the tighter crude market and the surge in Brent prices over the past three weeks.On macroeconomics, the latest data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) showed that US inflation, measured by the personal consumption expenditures (CPE) index, eased further to 2.6% year on year in May, matching expectations. The core PCE, excluding food and fuel prices, also decreased to 2.6%, the lowest since March 2021.These figures are pivotal for the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate-setting decision on 31 July, with markets anticipating at least two quarter-point rate cuts this year, potentially starting in September. Despite the encouraging inflation data, a September cut remains uncertain as the pace of decline remains slow, which may be perceived as too gradual. On the political front, the US Presidential debate on Thursday night has dominated the airwaves.Early policy indications suggest either candidate would favour protectionist measures and large budget deficits if elected.This isn't good news for inflation, as both stances are inflationary.Energy-specific messaging was hard to identify in the debate, but it's safe to assume that a Trump administration would be pro-deregulation while Biden would continue to push policies aimed at advancing the green transition. In Europe, French President Emmanuel Macron's decision to call snap elections for the National Assembly backfired on Sunday as the National Rally party won by a significant margin in the first round of voting. Macron took a huge risk, but with the second round of voting this coming weekend, the exact fallout is still unclear.The second round of voting on 7 July will be pivotal for France's political stability and its leadership within the EU and the transatlantic community during this critical period.
