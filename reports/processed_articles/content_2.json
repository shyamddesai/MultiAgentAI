Similarly, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose by 20 cents to USD82.41 per barrel, marking a 0.2 percent gain.The attempted assassination of U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump earlier in the week contributed to market uncertainty, according to Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG. This event has cast a shadow over the political landscape of a deeply divided country as it approaches the election period, potentially influencing market sentiment.Geopolitical risks in the Middle East also played a role in supporting oil prices, highlighting ongoing concerns about regional stability. Furthermore, the market remains bolstered by the continuing supply cuts by OPEC+ members. Iraq's oil ministry has pledged to counter any excess oil production starting from 2024, indicating a commitment to manage global supply levels amidst market fluctuations.Despite these factors, oil prices had faced downward pressure last week. Brent crude had declined by more than 1.7 percent after four consecutive weeks of gains, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures dropped by 1.1 percent. This decline was attributed to weak demand for oil in China, the largest importer of crude globally, where crude oil imports fell by 2.3 percent in the first half of the year to 11.05 million barrels per day. Factors contributing to this decline included disappointing fuel demand and reduced output by independent refiners amid narrow profit margins.China's economic slowdown in the second quarter, exacerbated by challenges such as a prolonged property downturn and job market instability, has raised expectations for additional stimulus measures from Beijing to bolster domestic demand. These developments are closely monitored by market participants for potential implications on global oil consumption and economic recovery trends.
