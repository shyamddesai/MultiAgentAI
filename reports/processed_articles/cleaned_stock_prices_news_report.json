The prompt month ticked lower to $2.452 when the EIA data was released, a day early because of the Fourth of July holiday. About 20 minutes later, the contract stood at $2.456, up 2.1 cents from Tuesday's settlement. Prior to the report, NGI modeled a 29 Bcf build. Early estimates to Reuters ranged from builds of 13 Bcf to 76 Bcf, with an average increase of 41 Bcf. The five-year average build was 69 Bcf for the week, while a year ago it was 76 Bcf.

That is down $0.57 or -0.68%.The price moved lower after trading to a two-month high to $84.38 earlier in the day. That was just $0.08 from the April 26 high target at $84.46 (see chart above).On the downside, the 61.8% retracement of the move down from the April high to the June low comes in at $81.84. That was near high levels going back to June to the end of June, before the break higher yesterday.  Crude oil technical levels in play The decline today came on falling fears of supply disruptions from Hurricane Beryl and despite escalating Middle East tensions. Forecasts now call for the hurricane to unlikely impact offshore oil production significantly. Meanwhile, geopolitical concerns rose after Israel reported 18 soldiers injured in a drone attack by Iran-backed Hezbollah. On the demand side, U.S. gasoline consumption is expected to peak with increased travel for the Independence Day holiday, forecasted to be 5.2% higher than in 2023. Recently, oil prices have been supported by OPEC+ extending oil output cuts until 2025.

    "Content": "      Crude oil futures and settle at $83.38 | Forexlive        ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW     Home    >  Technical Analysis  >  Crude oil futures and settle at $83.38     Technical Analysis      Oil   Crude oil futures and settle at $83.38   Up $1.84 or 2.26% on the day      Greg Michalowski    Monday, 01/07/2024 | 18:45 GMT-0     01/07/2024 | 18:45 GMT-0      0       Crude oil futures are settling at $83.38. That is up $1.84 or 2.26% on the day. The gain is the largest one day gain since June 10 when the index rose 2.93% and driven by expectations of higher summer demand and concerns over potential supply shortages due to OPEC+ production cuts. Oil prices increased by 6% in June, supported by OPEC+ extending output cuts until 2025. Analysts foresee supply deficits in the third quarter as summer travel and increased air-conditioning usage reduce fuel reserves. Investors are awaiting comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the central bank's policy meeting minutes on Wednesday, and U.S. nonfarm payroll data on Friday to gauge the direction for ageless rates and the economy. Additionally, traders are monitoring the impact of hurricanes on oil and gas production, with Hurricane Beryl threatening the Caribbean's Windward Islands.  Crude oil is moving away from the 61.8% retracement Technically, after moving above the 50% retracement of the move down from the April 2024 high at $80.06 back on June 18, the price consolidated between the 61.8% at $81.84 and the 50% midpoint at $80.06 until breaking higher on Friday. That break, however, did retrace back toward the 61.8% retracement level into Friday's close (see yellow area on the chart above). Today, the trend was more to the upside extending to the highest levels since April 29.The next target comes in against the April 26 high price at $84.46. The close risk now comes against the 61.8% retracement at $81.84.

Expand   Ahead of the 12 p.m. ET print, the August futures contract was up 2.0 cents at $2.455/MMBtu. The prompt month ticked lower to $2.452 when the EIA data was released, a day early because of the Fourth of July holiday. About 20 minutes later, the contract stood at $2.456, up 2.1 cents from Tuesday's settlement. Prior to the report, NGI modeled a 29 Bcf build. Early estimates to Reuters ranged from builds of 13 Bcf to 76 Bcf, with an average increase of 41 Bcf. The five-year average build was 69 Bcf for the week, while a year ago it was 76 Bcf.
