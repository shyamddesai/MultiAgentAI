    "Content": " Dangote Refinery: Crude oil supply options - Blueprint Newspapers Limited      Skip to content   The international corporations drilling oil in Nigeria are the country's greatest enemies. They have never hidden their condescension for Nigeria even as they are allowed to operate the industry on their own terms. In fact, the IOCs are partially responsible for Nigeria's total dependence on imported refined petroleum products.The international oil companies (IOCs) are compelled to operate refineries in most of the countries they drill oil. In Nigeria they defiantly snubbed the federal government's directives that they should establish refineries. Their excuse was that no refinery could succeed in Nigeria because the federal government stands around to fix unacceptable pump prices for refined petroleum products.Aliko Dangote, president of the Dangote Group, and some development banks in the international money market came together to prove that the treacherous oil firms exploiting crude oil in Nigeria were telling transparent lies when they refused to establish refineries in Nigeria on the grounds that the pump prices of refined petroleum products were controlled by the federal government. The international money market advanced loans close to $9 billion to Dangote for the establishment of what is now acknowledged as one of the world's largest refineries.No one would advance such a colossal sum as a loan for a venture known to have no means of repaying the loan. The fact that the international development banks were willing to fund Dangote Refinery is a clear indication that the venture was viable and could not be bugged down by government regulation of the pump prices of refined petroleum products.The lies of the IOCs were exposed by the success in sourcing for funds to build a giant refinery in Nigeria.The mischievous oil firms were disgraced as their lies were exposed. They gnashed their teeth and proceeded to wait for Dangote and the Nigerian people down the road.The refinery they were determined to truncate came on stream in January 2024 and in apparent frustration they drew up fresh plans to sabotage the business of the refinery and keep Nigeria as a perpetual importer of refined petroleum products.They know that if Dangote Refinery succeeds, the refineries in Europe that were supplying refined petroleum products to Nigeria at a catastrophic cost of well over $20 billion annually could be out of businessThey decided to use the last weapon in their armoury to frustrate Dangote Refinery. They defiantly refused to sell crude oil to Dangote. Those who reluctantly offer to sell the feedstock put their price tag at $6 above what obtains in the international market.Consequently, Dangote has been compelled to import crude oil for his refinery from the United States of America (USA) when Nigeria remains the highest producer of crude oil in Africa.The treacherous international oil companies operating in Nigeria have finally held Dangote Refinery and the Nigerian people in the jugular.Diesel from Dangote Refinery is more expensive than the high sulfur diesels imported by independent petroleum marketers from Europe into Nigeria.The most painful aspect of the sabotage by the IOCs is that the regulator of the industry sees nothing wrong with collaborating with foreigners to frustrate a Nigerian venture designed to ease the merciless grip of European petroleum refiners on Nigerians.The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) apathetically issues licences to independent petroleum marketers to import diesel from Europe with a weak naira and torment Nigerian consumers with high energy cost that escalates the country's catastrophic inflationary trend.When newsmen confronted the agency on the illogicality of encouraging diesel imports when a Nigerian refinery is ready to supply, NMDPRA retorted that in a deregulated market, marketers are free to source diesel from anywhere.NMDPRA is the regulatory arm of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL). The company is more or less an appendage of the mischievous international oil companies battling to protect the interest of European crude oil refiners patronised by NNPCL.NNPCL, as industry regulator, could order the deceitful IOCs to sell crude oil to Dangote Refinery at international market price. But it could only do so to the detriment of its own selfish interest.NNPCL would lose trillions of naira if Dangote Refinery gets crude oil from Nigeria and sells refined petroleum products locally at reduced pump prices.That would mean the end of the petrol subsidy scandal through which the company rakes in trillions of naira annually. That explains why NNPCL allows foreign exploiters to frustrate Dangote Refinery.NNPCL has unrestrained powers to supply crude oil to Dangote Refinery which at the moment is the only way to ease the asphyxiating hold of high energy cost on Nigeria's economy.If the treacherous IOCs defy NNPCL's directive to supply crude oil to Dangote Refinery at international market rate, the company could do the job by itself.NNPCL allocates 445,000 barrels of crude oil daily to Nigeria's moribund refineries. Nigeria's four refineries have not refined a barrel of crude oil in the last three years.Consequently, NNPCL exports the 445,000 barrels of crude oil daily to foreign refineries that feed Nigeria with refined petroleum products in return. If NNPCL reroutes the crude oil to Dangote Refinery, Nigeria would benefit extensively.The foreign refineries use the residue of the crude oil supplied by NNPCL for their petrochemical products and export them to Nigeria. If Dangote Refinery gets the crude oil, the residue would be used to produce resins that would be used to ease the escalating cost of producing plastic containers in the soft drink and brewery industries.Besides, NNPCL owes Dangote Refinery the sum of $1.7 billion as part of the 20 per cent equity it bought. It was expected to pay back with 300,000 barrels of crude oil daily. Its refusal to supply borders on betrayal of trust.It is rather saddening that Mele Kyari, the man who navigated NNPCL through the horrendous petrol subsidy scandal and crude oil theft, is still its group managing director. The man should do the right thing.

Front-month gas futures for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 2.4 cents, or 1.0%, to $2.454 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 8:49 a.m. EDT (1249 GMT), putting the contract on track for its lowest close since May 15 for a second day in a row.       Advertisement:  The National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC) NGC's HSSE strategy is reflective and supportive of the organisational vision to become a leader in the global energy business. ngc.co.tt           In other news, a federal judge dealt U.S. President Joe Biden's climate agenda a setback by blocking the Democrat's administration from continuing to pause the approval of applications to export liquefied natural gas (LNG). In Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), power grid operator for most of the state, said peak demand this week will come close to but not break the record for the month of July as homes and businesses crank up their air conditioners to escape a heat wave. In the spot market, next-day gas prices at the Waha hub in West Texas plunged by about 123% to a negative 52 cents per mmBtu for Tuesday as pipeline constraints trap gas in the Permian Shale again. That is the third time in six days Waha prices fell into negative territory during the current heat wave and the 20th time so far this year. Next-day Waha prices first averaged below zero in 2019. It happened 17 times in 2019, six in 2020, none in 2021 and 2022, and once in 2023. In the Caribbean Sea, Hurricane Beryl, an extremely dangerous major hurricane, will hit Jamaica on Wednesday before slamming slam into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the latest U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) outlook. After marching across the Yucatan, the NHC projected Beryl will weaken into a tropical storm by the time it enters the Bay of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico, where Mexico produces much of its oil, on Saturday before approaching the Texas-Mexico border on Sunday. SUPPLY AND DEMAND Financial firm LSEG said gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states rose to an average of 101.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in July. That was up from an average of 100.1 bcfd in June and a 17-month low of 99.5 bcfd in May as many producers reduced drilling activities after prices fell to 3-1/2-year lows in February and March. U.S. output hit a monthly record high of 105.5 bcfd in December 2023. Meteorologists projected weather across the Lower 48 states would remain hotter than normal through at least July 17. With hotter weather expected next week, LSEG forecast average gas demand in the Lower 48, including exports, will rise from 98.5 bcfd this week to 104.5 bcfd next week. Those forecasts were lower than LSEG's outlook on Monday. Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants fell to 12.2 bcfd so far in July, down from 12.8 bcfd in June and a monthly record high of 14.7 bcfd in December 2023. That decline was due mostly to an expected drop in feedgas at Cheniere Energy's 4.5-bcfd Sabine Pass in Louisiana to a one-week low of 3.7 bcfd on Tuesday, down from 4.1 bcfd on Monday and an average of 4.0 bcfd over the prior seven days.

The spokesperson also said that it was agreed that 21 liquefied natural gas cargos are to arrive in Egypt during the summer, in addition to shipments of mazut fuel.       Advertisement:  The National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC) NGC's HSSE strategy is reflective and supportive of the organisational vision to become a leader in the global energy business. ngc.co.tt           The first gas shipment arrived on Monday, and it is currently being discharged for supply into the national gas grid, the ministry spokesperson said. \"With the third week of July...the national gas grid's supply will be sufficient,\" he added. In June, Egypt fully awarded 20 cargoes of LNG in its biggest purchase of the seaborne fuel, aimed to cover heavy summer demand from July through September. Supplies of the natural gas that helps Egypt generate electricity have been dwindling at a time when an expanding population and urban development have been pushing up electricity demand. When temperatures rise, air conditioning use drives up power consumption. Egypt needs to import around $1.18 billion worth of natural gas and mazut fuel oil to end persistent power cuts exacerbated by consecutive heatwaves, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said last month.

We have declared war on the challenges affecting our crude oil production. War means war. We have the right tools. We know what to fight. We know what we have to do at the level of assets. We have engaged our partners, and we will work together to improve the situation,\" the GCEO declared.According to him, a detailed analysis of assets revealed that Nigeria can conveniently produce two million barrels of crude oil per day without deploying new rigs, but the major impediment to achieving that remains the inability of players to act in a timely manner.He said the \"war\" will help NNPC Ltd. and its partners to speedily clear all identified obstacles to effective and efficient production such as delays in procurement processes, which have become a challenge in the industry.On medium to long-term measures aimed at boosting and sustaining production, Kyari said NNPC Ltd. would replace all the old crude oil pipelines built over four decades ago and also introduce a rig sharing programme with its partners to ensure that production rigs stay in the country for between four and five years which is the standard practice in most climes.He called on all players in the industry to collaborate towards reducing the cost of production and boosting production to target levels.He expressed the Company's commitment to investing in critical midstream gas infrastructure such as the Obiafu-Obrikom-Oben (OB3) and the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano gas pipelines to boost domestic gas production and supply for power generation, industrial development and economic prosperity of the country.On Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Kyari observed that NNPC Ltd. has since keyed into the Presidential CNG drive, adding that in conjunction with partners such as NIPCO Gas, NNPC Ltd. has built a number of CNG stations, 12 of which will be commissioned on Thursday in Lagos and Abuja.The opening ceremony of the NOG Energy Week also saw goodwill messages and keynotes presented by the Secretary General of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Haitham Al Ghais; Secretary General of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), Engr. Mohamed Hamel; Minister of State for Petroleum Resources (Oil), Senator Heineken Lokpobiri; Minister of State for Petroleum Resources (Gas), Rt. Hon.

Isa made the call at the Nigerian Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week 2024 in Abuja with the theme, \"Showcasing opportunities, driving investment and meeting energy demand.\"   Advertisement  He told the participants at the event that the approval of IOCs divestment will also restore global investor confidence in Nigeria at a time of huge competition for investments in the energy sector. The IPPG Chairman stated further that despite huge hydrocarbon resource base, with over 37 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves and 207 tcf and 600 tcf of proven gas reserves, the country is currently in a situation where the daily production has significantly dropped to about 1.3 million barrels of crude oil per day and 8.5 billion standard cubic feet of gas per day respectively. This, he noted, is far below the nation's capacity, noting that Nigeria now runs the risk of partial implementation of its national budget considering an estimated deficit of 400,000 bpd from the forecasted 1.78 million bpd. He said, \"IPPG strongly advocates that our member companies - Seplat, the Renaissance Consortium and Oando - have the proven track record to successfully take over and manage these onshore and shallow water assets to realise incremental production in the region of 100,000 - 200,000 barrels of oil and over 1.5 billion SCF of gas per day within 24 months and well over 500,000 barrels of oil per day in the long term.  Advertisement  \"IPPG believes the timely approval of these IOC divestment transactions will also be a clear signal capable of restoring global investor confidence in Nigeria in an era of competing global investment destinations in Africa and very limited access to capital. \"The urgent need to address deepwater development and production by untangling issues around deepwater development, particularly in terms of competitive fiscal regime being negotiated with Shell, Total Energies, ExxonMobil and Chevron, has the potential to unlock incremental production of 700,000 barrels per day from this terrain in the short to medium term.

Jun 6, 2024           \"Enabling deepwater development will attract significant economic benefits as Nigeria has one of the world's largest untapped deepwater resource bases.\" Isa also the hairman and Co-Founder of Waltersmith Group of Companies called for the adoption of a national value-retention strategy, stating that Nigeria's domestic crude oil refining and petrochemical capacity must be sustained primarily from its domestic crude oil and gas production. He noted that this would transform the country into a net exporter of refined petroleum and petrochemical products that will lay a strong foundation for the rapid industrialization of the Nigerian economy.  Advertisement  \"It is therefore imperative to grow our daily production to 2.5 million barrels of oil and 10 bcf of gas in the near to long term to ensure we can meet our domestic refinery and petrochemical demands and export commitments to generate the much-needed foreign exchange earnings for macro-economic stability. \"The development of Nigeria's gas resources to catalyse economic growth and complement decarbonisation drive as Nigeria's vast gas resources must be exploited with immediate focus placed on restoring production to existing installed LNG capacity and expanding production (FLNG). \"In addition, we must expand domestic gas utilization (Gas-to-Power; Gas-Based Industries) by investing heavily to address the gas infrastructure deficit facing us today. The International Oil Companies will lead the charge on export gas while IPPG members will drive the domestic gas agenda led by NNPCL,\" he added. Isa noted that the priorities would provide the most realistic and sustainable pathway towards meeting the national long-term production aspiration of four million barrels of oil per day and 13 billion cubic feet of gas per day.

Isa made the call at the Nigerian Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week 2024 in Abuja with the theme, \"Showcasing opportunities, driving investment and meeting energy demand.\"   Advertisement  He told the participants at the event that the approval of IOCs divestment will also restore global investor confidence in Nigeria at a time of huge competition for investments in the energy sector. The IPPG Chairman stated further that despite huge hydrocarbon resource base, with over 37 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves and 207 tcf and 600 tcf of proven gas reserves, the country is currently in a situation where the daily production has significantly dropped to about 1.3 million barrels of crude oil per day and 8.5 billion standard cubic feet of gas per day respectively. This, he noted, is far below the nation's capacity, noting that Nigeria now runs the risk of partial implementation of its national budget considering an estimated deficit of 400,000 bpd from the forecasted 1.78 million bpd. He said, \"IPPG strongly advocates that our member companies - Seplat, the Renaissance Consortium and Oando - have the proven track record to successfully take over and manage these onshore and shallow water assets to realise incremental production in the region of 100,000 - 200,000 barrels of oil and over 1.5 billion SCF of gas per day within 24 months and well over 500,000 barrels of oil per day in the long term.  Advertisement  \"IPPG believes the timely approval of these IOC divestment transactions will also be a clear signal capable of restoring global investor confidence in Nigeria in an era of competing global investment destinations in Africa and very limited access to capital. \"The urgent need to address deepwater development and production by untangling issues around deepwater development, particularly in terms of competitive fiscal regime being negotiated with Shell, Total Energies, ExxonMobil and Chevron, has the potential to unlock incremental production of 700,000 barrels per day from this terrain in the short to medium term.

He noted that this would transform the country into a net exporter of refined petroleum and petrochemical products that will lay a strong foundation for the rapid industrialization of the Nigerian economy.  Advertisement  \"It is therefore imperative to grow our daily production to 2.5 million barrels of oil and 10 bcf of gas in the near to long term to ensure we can meet our domestic refinery and petrochemical demands and export commitments to generate the much-needed foreign exchange earnings for macro-economic stability. \"The development of Nigeria's gas resources to catalyse economic growth and complement decarbonisation drive as Nigeria's vast gas resources must be exploited with immediate focus placed on restoring production to existing installed LNG capacity and expanding production (FLNG). \"In addition, we must expand domestic gas utilization (Gas-to-Power; Gas-Based Industries) by investing heavily to address the gas infrastructure deficit facing us today. The International Oil Companies will lead the charge on export gas while IPPG members will drive the domestic gas agenda led by NNPCL,\" he added. Isa noted that the priorities would provide the most realistic and sustainable pathway towards meeting the national long-term production aspiration of four million barrels of oil per day and 13 billion cubic feet of gas per day.

Group Chief Executive Officer of NNPC Ltd, Mr. Mele Kyari, disclosed this in a keynote address at the opening ceremony of the 23rd edition of the Nigeria Oil & Gas Conference and Exhibition (NOG Energy Week) in Abuja, on Tuesday. \"We have decided to stop the debate. We have declared war on the challenges affecting our crude oil production. War means war. We have the right tools. We know what to fight. We know what we have to do at the level of assets. We have engaged our partners. And we will work together to improve the situation,\" the GCEO declared. According to him, a detailed analysis of assets revealed that Nigeria can conveniently produce two million barrels of crude oil per day without deploying new rigs, but the major impediment to achieving that remains the inability of players to act in a timely manner. He said the \"war\" will help NNPC Ltd. and its partners to speedily clear all identified obstacles to effective and efficient production such as delays in procurement processes, which have become a challenge in the industry. On medium to long-term measures aimed at boosting and sustaining production, Kyari said NNPC Ltd. would replace all the old crude oil pipelines built over four decades ago and also introduce a rig sharing programme with its partners to ensure that production rigs stay in the country for between four and five years which is the standard practice in most climes. He called on all players in the industry to collaborate towards reducing the cost of production and boosting production to target levels. He expressed the Company's commitment to investing in critical midstream gas infrastructure such as the Obiafu-Obrikom-Oben (OB3) and the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano gas pipelines to boost domestic gas production and supply for power generation, industrial development and economic prosperity of the country. On Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Kyari observed that NNPC Ltd. has since keyed into the Presidential CNG drive, adding that in conjunction with partners such as NIPCO Gas, NNPC Ltd. has built a number of CNG stations, 12 of which will be commissioned on Thursday in Lagos and Abuja. NNPC Ltd. is the Principal Sponsor of 2024 NOG Energy Week Conference & Exhibition which has as its theme \"showcasing opportunities, driving investment and meeting energy demand.\" However, with Nigeria's oil production lagging significantly behind OPEC oil production quota, the Minister for State Petroleum Resources (Oil), Senator Heineken Lokpobiri has expressed the Federal Government's determination to improve production in the coming months. The Minister stated this when he gave his ministerial address at the ongoing 2024 NOG week Lokpobiri emphasized Nigeria's commitment to increasing oil production, adding that while Nigeria \"is not in a rush to transition away from oil, the country is actively seeking to enhance its production capabilities\". According to him, \"We are focused on ramping up our oil production . When we came to office the president was concerned in increasing production in every way. I can confidently tell you that most of the deals like Seplat -ExxonMobil deal and other issues like Malabu deal are being resolved. He highlighted the benefits of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which provides a robust legal framework that guarantees returns on investments and has significantly reshaped the oil and gas sector. \"The PIA ensures a secure and profitable investment climate, making Nigeria an attractive location for investors,\" he noted.  .IPPG laments delays in concluding IOCs' divestment transactions  The Independent Petroleum Producers Group (IPPG) has expressed concerns over the continuos delays in concluding ongoing divestment transactions by the international oil companies (IOCs). Chairman of IPPG, Mr. Abdulrazaq Isa, raised his members' concerns yesterday in Abuja at the ongoing Nigeria Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week 2024, with the theme: \"Showcasing Opportunities, Driving Investment and Meeting Energy Demand\". In his industry address at the event, Isa specifically said that the long-overdrawn delays in concluding the IOCs divestment deals were costly to the Nigerian petroleum industry and extremely detrimental to the country as a whole. He appreciated President Bola Tinubu for the transformative reforms being undertaken by his administratio, pointing out specifically that the recent presidential executive orders and directives were a welcome development for the industry. \"Also of note is His Excellency's direct intervention in untangling issues in some of the long-overdrawn IOC divestment transactions - these delays have been costly to the industry and extremely detrimental to the nation as a whole. \"We are encouraged to see swift progress on implementation and some tangible results within a relatively short period of time. \"Such progressive and impactful policies are exactly what the industry has consistently clamoured for to sustainably develop and move the industry forward\", Isa stated. Notwithstanding those laudable policies and the gradual positive turnarounds being experienced, he maintained that the industry was in dire need of extraordinary focus to mitigate the genuine concerns on its long-term sustainability. According to him, despite Nigeria's world class hydrocarbon resource base of over 37 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves and 207 trillion cubic feet (tcf) and 600 tcf of proven and contingent gas reserves respectively, we find ourselves in a situation where our daily production has significantly dropped and lies at about 1.3 million barrels of oil and 8.5 bcf of gas today. He noted that the current oil and gas production was way below Nigeria's capacity as a nation. He added that by all globally acceptable standards, this reserves to production ratio was extremely low and a clear indicator that the industry was in a dire situation. In addition, Isa noted that \"we now run the risk of partial implementation of our national budget considering an estimated deficit of 400,000 bpd from the forecasted 1.78 million bpd. This trend in production, according to the IPPG chair, \"portends another frightening dimension when we consider that in the not-too-distant future, our overall installed domestic refining capacity, currently closing in on about 1.2 million barrels per day, may soon outstrip our current crude oil production level with the risk of Nigeria finding itself in a position where it is unable to meet its domestic refinery crude demand or even become a net importer of crude oil, God forbid! \"It is against this scary backdrop that IPPG is calling for urgent measures to be undertaken by all relevant stakeholders to immediately arrest this dwindling production level and under-investment by focusing on the following priority areas.\" On the first priority area, he called for immediate conclusion of all pending IOC divestment transactions. Isa posited that IPPG strongly advocates that their member companies such as Seplat, the Renaissance Consortium and Oando have the proven track record to successfully take over and manage those onshore and shallow water assets to realise incremental production in the region of 100,000 - 200,000 barrels of oil and over 1.5bcf of gas per day within 24 months, and well over 500,000bpd in the long term. He maintained that IPPG believes the timely approval of these IOC divestment transactions would also be a clear signal capable of restoring global investor confidence in Nigeria in an era of competing global investment destinations in Africa and very limited access to capital. On the second priority area, Isa stressed the urgent need to address deepwater development and production in Nigeria. He said untangling issues around deepwater development, particularly in terms of competitive fiscal regime being negotiated with Shell, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil and Chevron has the potential to unlock incremental production of 700,000 bpd from this terrain in the short to medium term. Isa stated, \"Enabling deepwater development will attract significant economic benefits as Nigeria has one of the world's largest untapped deepwater resource base. \"Priority Area 3: The adoption of a national value-retention strategy: Nigeria's domestic crude oil refining and petrochemical capacity must be sustained primarily from our domestic crude oil and gas production in order to transform our country into a net exporter of refined petroleum and petrochemical products that will lay a strong foundation for the rapid industrialization of the Nigerian economy. \"It is therefore imperative to grow our daily production to 2.5 million barrels of oil and 10 bcf of gas in the near to long term to ensure we are able to meet our domestic refinery and petrochemical demands and export commitments to generate the much-needed foreign exchange earnings for macro-economic stability.\" On the fourth priority area, the IPPG boss called for the development of Nigeria's gas resources to catalyse economic growth and complement decarbonisation drive. He stressed that Nigeria's vast gas resources must be exploited with immediate focus placed on restoring production to existing installed Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) capacity and expanding production (FLNG).  .We see energy demand rising by 23% by 2045 - OPEC  Meanwhile, The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) says energy demand will rise by an estimated 23 per cent by 2025. OPEC says the rise will be fueled by a world economy that is expected to double in size, growing from $138 trillion dollars in 2023 to $270 trillion dollars in 2045. The OPEC Secretary-General, Haitham Al Ghais, made this known on Tuesday at the ongoing 23rd Nigerian Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week Conference and Exhibition, holding in Abuja. The conference, which holds from June 30 to July 4, has its theme as \"Showcasing Opportunities, Driving Investment, Meeting Energy Demand\". Addressing the Strategic Conference via teleconference, Al Ghais explained that it forecasted a rapidly expanding world population that would surpass 9.5 billion people. \"Why are we optimistic? Let us consider these statistics, which are based on OPEC's World Oil Outlook. \"Urbanisation alone will account for over half a billion people moving to cities around the world by 2030. \"This data tells us that the world will require all forms of energy to meet long-term energy needs. \"Oil and gas will remain the predominant fuels in the energy mix. \"In fact, oil alone will retain its share at almost 30 per cent in 2045 as world demand for oil soars to an estimated 116 million barrels per day (mb/d) by that time,\" he said. To meet this rapid and robust growth in energy consumption, he said the industry would need to boost investment levels significantly in the years to come. He said according to its research, cumulative oil-related investment requirements from 2024 until 2045 would amount to $14 trillion dollars or around $610 billion dollars on average per year. \"Securing this vital funding is essential to maintaining security of supply and avoiding unwanted volatility. \"In spite of these facts, I am certain you are aware of some recent predictions for peak demand by 2030 and calls for a discontinuation of investment in hydrocarbons,\" he said. Al Ghais further emphasised that indeed, the rush to adopt \"Net-Zero\" strategies was misguided and simply not realistic. The OPEC Secretary General said that developing countries would continue to balance priorities between developing their national economies and addressing climate change. In this regard, he pledged that OPEC and its member countries would continue to advocate for a fair process for adaptation, mitigation and means of implementation, with regard to climate finance and technology. He decried the fact that there were an estimated 675 million people with no access to basic forms of energy and 2.3 billion without access to clean cooking fuels. He tasked World leaders to unite and advocate for the necessary support and resources to make a difference in addressing this important matter. \"Looking ahead, OPEC will continue to enhance dialogue and cooperation with all of its energy partners, including in Africa,\" Al Ghais said. The Secretary-General, while commending President Bola Tinubu, appreciated Nigeria's staunch commitment to OPEC and to the Declaration of Cooperation.

Front-month gas futures for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 2.4 cents, or 1.0%, to $2.454 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at 8:49 a.m. EDT (1249 GMT), putting the contract on track for its lowest close since May 15 for a second day in a row.       Advertisement:  The National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC) NGC's HSSE strategy is reflective and supportive of the organisational vision to become a leader in the global energy business. ngc.co.tt           In other news, a federal judge dealt U.S. President Joe Biden's climate agenda a setback by blocking the Democrat's administration from continuing to pause the approval of applications to export liquefied natural gas (LNG). In Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), power grid operator for most of the state, said peak demand this week will come close to but not break the record for the month of July as homes and businesses crank up their air conditioners to escape a heat wave. In the spot market, next-day gas prices at the Waha hub in West Texas plunged by about 123% to a negative 52 cents per mmBtu for Tuesday as pipeline constraints trap gas in the Permian Shale again. That is the third time in six days Waha prices fell into negative territory during the current heat wave and the 20th time so far this year. Next-day Waha prices first averaged below zero in 2019. It happened 17 times in 2019, six in 2020, none in 2021 and 2022, and once in 2023. In the Caribbean Sea, Hurricane Beryl, an extremely dangerous major hurricane, will hit Jamaica on Wednesday before slamming slam into Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Friday, according to the latest U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) outlook. After marching across the Yucatan, the NHC projected Beryl will weaken into a tropical storm by the time it enters the Bay of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico, where Mexico produces much of its oil, on Saturday before approaching the Texas-Mexico border on Sunday. SUPPLY AND DEMAND Financial firm LSEG said gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states rose to an average of 101.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in July. That was up from an average of 100.1 bcfd in June and a 17-month low of 99.5 bcfd in May as many producers reduced drilling activities after prices fell to 3-1/2-year lows in February and March. U.S. output hit a monthly record high of 105.5 bcfd in December 2023. Meteorologists projected weather across the Lower 48 states would remain hotter than normal through at least July 17. With hotter weather expected next week, LSEG forecast average gas demand in the Lower 48, including exports, will rise from 98.5 bcfd this week to 104.5 bcfd next week. Those forecasts were lower than LSEG's outlook on Monday. Gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants fell to 12.2 bcfd so far in July, down from 12.8 bcfd in June and a monthly record high of 14.7 bcfd in December 2023. That decline was due mostly to an expected drop in feedgas at Cheniere Energy's 4.5-bcfd Sabine Pass in Louisiana to a one-week low of 3.7 bcfd on Tuesday, down from 4.1 bcfd on Monday and an average of 4.0 bcfd over the prior seven days.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries produced an average of 26.98 million barrels per day in June, marking a decrease of 80,000 barrels per day from the previous month. This slight reduction was attributed to minor cuts in production from Iraq and Nigeria. The survey indicated that Iraq and the UAE did not fully comply with the cuts agreed upon at the beginning of the year with other OPEC members. Additionally, Baghdad was unable to implement the extra production cut it had pledged to compensate for previous overproduction levels. To push crude oil prices higher, the OPEC alliance may need to enforce the committed cuts fully. However, efforts to enhance compliance have shown limited results. In June, Iraq reduced its output by 30,000 barrels per day to 4.25 million barrels per day. This reduction in exports brought the country closer to its assigned quota, but its production still exceeded the quota by approximately 250,000 barrels per day, even without considering additional \"compensatory cuts.\"             Related News           Bloomberg: Iraq reduced its oil production by 130,000 bpd             Iraq boosts oil output by 40,000 bpd in May following OPEC decision             Basrah crudes surge following global oil rise             Basrah crudes surge despite global oil decline             Kirkuk oil production surges to over 360,000 bpd             EIA reports surge in Iraqi oil exports to the US                     Shafaq Live     Shafaq Live     English                 English        Radio            facebook       Shafaq news english      ",

Group Chief Executive Officer of NNPC Ltd, Mr. Mele Kyari, disclosed this in a keynote address at the opening ceremony of the 23rd edition of the Nigeria Oil & Gas Conference and Exhibition (NOG Energy Week) in Abuja, on Tuesday. \"We have decided to stop the debate. We have declared war on the challenges affecting our crude oil production. War means war. We have the right tools. We know what to fight. We know what we have to do at the level of assets. We have engaged our partners. And we will work together to improve the situation,\" the GCEO declared. According to him, a detailed analysis of assets revealed that Nigeria can conveniently produce two million barrels of crude oil per day without deploying new rigs, but the major impediment to achieving that remains the inability of players to act in a timely manner. He said the \"war\" will help NNPC Ltd. and its partners to speedily clear all identified obstacles to effective and efficient production such as delays in procurement processes, which have become a challenge in the industry. On medium to long-term measures aimed at boosting and sustaining production, Kyari said NNPC Ltd. would replace all the old crude oil pipelines built over four decades ago and also introduce a rig sharing programme with its partners to ensure that production rigs stay in the country for between four and five years which is the standard practice in most climes. He called on all players in the industry to collaborate towards reducing the cost of production and boosting production to target levels. He expressed the Company's commitment to investing in critical midstream gas infrastructure such as the Obiafu-Obrikom-Oben (OB3) and the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano gas pipelines to boost domestic gas production and supply for power generation, industrial development and economic prosperity of the country. On Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Kyari observed that NNPC Ltd. has since keyed into the Presidential CNG drive, adding that in conjunction with partners such as NIPCO Gas, NNPC Ltd. has built a number of CNG stations, 12 of which will be commissioned on Thursday in Lagos and Abuja. NNPC Ltd. is the Principal Sponsor of 2024 NOG Energy Week Conference & Exhibition which has as its theme \"showcasing opportunities, driving investment and meeting energy demand.\" However, with Nigeria's oil production lagging significantly behind OPEC oil production quota, the Minister for State Petroleum Resources (Oil), Senator Heineken Lokpobiri has expressed the Federal Government's determination to improve production in the coming months. The Minister stated this when he gave his ministerial address at the ongoing 2024 NOG week Lokpobiri emphasized Nigeria's commitment to increasing oil production, adding that while Nigeria \"is not in a rush to transition away from oil, the country is actively seeking to enhance its production capabilities\". According to him, \"We are focused on ramping up our oil production . When we came to office the president was concerned in increasing production in every way. I can confidently tell you that most of the deals like Seplat -ExxonMobil deal and other issues like Malabu deal are being resolved. He highlighted the benefits of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which provides a robust legal framework that guarantees returns on investments and has significantly reshaped the oil and gas sector. \"The PIA ensures a secure and profitable investment climate, making Nigeria an attractive location for investors,\" he noted.  .IPPG laments delays in concluding IOCs' divestment transactions  The Independent Petroleum Producers Group (IPPG) has expressed concerns over the continuos delays in concluding ongoing divestment transactions by the international oil companies (IOCs). Chairman of IPPG, Mr. Abdulrazaq Isa, raised his members' concerns yesterday in Abuja at the ongoing Nigeria Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week 2024, with the theme: \"Showcasing Opportunities, Driving Investment and Meeting Energy Demand\". In his industry address at the event, Isa specifically said that the long-overdrawn delays in concluding the IOCs divestment deals were costly to the Nigerian petroleum industry and extremely detrimental to the country as a whole. He appreciated President Bola Tinubu for the transformative reforms being undertaken by his administratio, pointing out specifically that the recent presidential executive orders and directives were a welcome development for the industry. \"Also of note is His Excellency's direct intervention in untangling issues in some of the long-overdrawn IOC divestment transactions - these delays have been costly to the industry and extremely detrimental to the nation as a whole. \"We are encouraged to see swift progress on implementation and some tangible results within a relatively short period of time. \"Such progressive and impactful policies are exactly what the industry has consistently clamoured for to sustainably develop and move the industry forward\", Isa stated. Notwithstanding those laudable policies and the gradual positive turnarounds being experienced, he maintained that the industry was in dire need of extraordinary focus to mitigate the genuine concerns on its long-term sustainability. According to him, despite Nigeria's world class hydrocarbon resource base of over 37 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves and 207 trillion cubic feet (tcf) and 600 tcf of proven and contingent gas reserves respectively, we find ourselves in a situation where our daily production has significantly dropped and lies at about 1.3 million barrels of oil and 8.5 bcf of gas today. He noted that the current oil and gas production was way below Nigeria's capacity as a nation. He added that by all globally acceptable standards, this reserves to production ratio was extremely low and a clear indicator that the industry was in a dire situation. In addition, Isa noted that \"we now run the risk of partial implementation of our national budget considering an estimated deficit of 400,000 bpd from the forecasted 1.78 million bpd. This trend in production, according to the IPPG chair, \"portends another frightening dimension when we consider that in the not-too-distant future, our overall installed domestic refining capacity, currently closing in on about 1.2 million barrels per day, may soon outstrip our current crude oil production level with the risk of Nigeria finding itself in a position where it is unable to meet its domestic refinery crude demand or even become a net importer of crude oil, God forbid! \"It is against this scary backdrop that IPPG is calling for urgent measures to be undertaken by all relevant stakeholders to immediately arrest this dwindling production level and under-investment by focusing on the following priority areas.\" On the first priority area, he called for immediate conclusion of all pending IOC divestment transactions. Isa posited that IPPG strongly advocates that their member companies such as Seplat, the Renaissance Consortium and Oando have the proven track record to successfully take over and manage those onshore and shallow water assets to realise incremental production in the region of 100,000 - 200,000 barrels of oil and over 1.5bcf of gas per day within 24 months, and well over 500,000bpd in the long term. He maintained that IPPG believes the timely approval of these IOC divestment transactions would also be a clear signal capable of restoring global investor confidence in Nigeria in an era of competing global investment destinations in Africa and very limited access to capital. On the second priority area, Isa stressed the urgent need to address deepwater development and production in Nigeria. He said untangling issues around deepwater development, particularly in terms of competitive fiscal regime being negotiated with Shell, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil and Chevron has the potential to unlock incremental production of 700,000 bpd from this terrain in the short to medium term. Isa stated, \"Enabling deepwater development will attract significant economic benefits as Nigeria has one of the world's largest untapped deepwater resource base. \"Priority Area 3: The adoption of a national value-retention strategy: Nigeria's domestic crude oil refining and petrochemical capacity must be sustained primarily from our domestic crude oil and gas production in order to transform our country into a net exporter of refined petroleum and petrochemical products that will lay a strong foundation for the rapid industrialization of the Nigerian economy. \"It is therefore imperative to grow our daily production to 2.5 million barrels of oil and 10 bcf of gas in the near to long term to ensure we are able to meet our domestic refinery and petrochemical demands and export commitments to generate the much-needed foreign exchange earnings for macro-economic stability.\" On the fourth priority area, the IPPG boss called for the development of Nigeria's gas resources to catalyse economic growth and complement decarbonisation drive. He stressed that Nigeria's vast gas resources must be exploited with immediate focus placed on restoring production to existing installed Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) capacity and expanding production (FLNG).  .We see energy demand rising by 23% by 2045 - OPEC  Meanwhile, The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) says energy demand will rise by an estimated 23 per cent by 2025. OPEC says the rise will be fueled by a world economy that is expected to double in size, growing from $138 trillion dollars in 2023 to $270 trillion dollars in 2045. The OPEC Secretary-General, Haitham Al Ghais, made this known on Tuesday at the ongoing 23rd Nigerian Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week Conference and Exhibition, holding in Abuja. The conference, which holds from June 30 to July 4, has its theme as \"Showcasing Opportunities, Driving Investment, Meeting Energy Demand\". Addressing the Strategic Conference via teleconference, Al Ghais explained that it forecasted a rapidly expanding world population that would surpass 9.5 billion people. \"Why are we optimistic? Let us consider these statistics, which are based on OPEC's World Oil Outlook. \"Urbanisation alone will account for over half a billion people moving to cities around the world by 2030. \"This data tells us that the world will require all forms of energy to meet long-term energy needs. \"Oil and gas will remain the predominant fuels in the energy mix. \"In fact, oil alone will retain its share at almost 30 per cent in 2045 as world demand for oil soars to an estimated 116 million barrels per day (mb/d) by that time,\" he said. To meet this rapid and robust growth in energy consumption, he said the industry would need to boost investment levels significantly in the years to come. He said according to its research, cumulative oil-related investment requirements from 2024 until 2045 would amount to $14 trillion dollars or around $610 billion dollars on average per year. \"Securing this vital funding is essential to maintaining security of supply and avoiding unwanted volatility. \"In spite of these facts, I am certain you are aware of some recent predictions for peak demand by 2030 and calls for a discontinuation of investment in hydrocarbons,\" he said. Al Ghais further emphasised that indeed, the rush to adopt \"Net-Zero\" strategies was misguided and simply not realistic. The OPEC Secretary General said that developing countries would continue to balance priorities between developing their national economies and addressing climate change. In this regard, he pledged that OPEC and its member countries would continue to advocate for a fair process for adaptation, mitigation and means of implementation, with regard to climate finance and technology. He decried the fact that there were an estimated 675 million people with no access to basic forms of energy and 2.3 billion without access to clean cooking fuels. He tasked World leaders to unite and advocate for the necessary support and resources to make a difference in addressing this important matter. \"Looking ahead, OPEC will continue to enhance dialogue and cooperation with all of its energy partners, including in Africa,\" Al Ghais said. The Secretary-General, while commending President Bola Tinubu, appreciated Nigeria's staunch commitment to OPEC and to the Declaration of Cooperation.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries produced an average of 26.98 million barrels per day in June, marking a decrease of 80,000 barrels per day from the previous month. This slight reduction was attributed to minor cuts in production from Iraq and Nigeria. The survey indicated that Iraq and the UAE did not fully comply with the cuts agreed upon at the beginning of the year with other OPEC members. Additionally, Baghdad was unable to implement the extra production cut it had pledged to compensate for previous overproduction levels. To push crude oil prices higher, the OPEC alliance may need to enforce the committed cuts fully. However, efforts to enhance compliance have shown limited results. In June, Iraq reduced its output by 30,000 barrels per day to 4.25 million barrels per day. This reduction in exports brought the country closer to its assigned quota, but its production still exceeded the quota by approximately 250,000 barrels per day, even without considering additional \"compensatory cuts.\"             Related News           Bloomberg: Iraq reduced its oil production by 130,000 bpd             Iraq boosts oil output by 40,000 bpd in May following OPEC decision             Basrah crudes surge following global oil rise             Basrah crudes surge despite global oil decline             Kirkuk oil production surges to over 360,000 bpd             EIA reports surge in Iraqi oil exports to the US                     Shafaq Live     Shafaq Live     English                 English        Radio            facebook       Shafaq news english      ",
