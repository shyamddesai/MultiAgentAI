    "Content": "Dangote Refinery: Crude oil supply options - Blueprint Newspapers Limited Skip to content The international corporations drilling oil in Nigeria are the country's greatest enemies. They have never hidden their condescension for Nigeria even as they are allowed to operate the industry on their own terms. In fact, the IOCs are partially responsible for Nigeria's total dependence on imported refined petroleum products.The international oil companies (IOCs) are compelled to operate refineries in most of the countries they drill oil. In Nigeria they defiantly snubbed the federal government's directives that they should establish refineries. Their excuse was that no refinery could succeed in Nigeria because the federal government stands around to fix unacceptable pump prices for refined petroleum products.Aliko Dangote, president of the Dangote Group, and some development banks in the international money market came together to prove that the treacherous oil firms exploiting crude oil in Nigeria were telling transparent lies when they refused to establish refineries in Nigeria on the grounds that the pump prices of refined petroleum products were controlled by the federal government. The international money market advanced loans close to $9 billion to Dangote for the establishment of what is now acknowledged as one of the world's largest refineries.No one would advance such a colossal sum as a loan for a venture known to have no means of repaying the loan. The fact that the international development banks were willing to fund Dangote Refinery is a clear indication that the venture was viable and could not be bugged down by government regulation of the pump prices of refined petroleum products.The lies of the IOCs were exposed by the success in sourcing for funds to build a giant refinery in Nigeria.The mischievous oil firms were disgraced as their lies were exposed. They gnashed their teeth and proceeded to wait for Dangote and the Nigerian people down the road.The refinery they were determined to truncate came on stream in January 2024 and in apparent frustration they drew up fresh plans to sabotage the business of the refinery and keep Nigeria as a perpetual importer of refined petroleum products.They know that if Dangote Refinery succeeds, the refineries in Europe that were supplying refined petroleum products to Nigeria at a catastrophic cost of well over $20 billion annually could be out of businessThey decided to use the last weapon in their armoury to frustrate Dangote Refinery. They defiantly refused to sell crude oil to Dangote. Those who reluctantly offer to sell the feedstock put their price tag at $6 above what obtains in the international market.Consequently, Dangote has been compelled to import crude oil for his refinery from the United States of America (USA) when Nigeria remains the highest producer of crude oil in Africa.The treacherous international oil companies operating in Nigeria have finally held Dangote Refinery and the Nigerian people in the jugular.Diesel from Dangote Refinery is more expensive than the high sulfur diesels imported by independent petroleum marketers from Europe into Nigeria.The most painful aspect of the sabotage by the IOCs is that the regulator of the industry sees nothing wrong with collaborating with foreigners to frustrate a Nigerian venture designed to ease the merciless grip of European petroleum refiners on Nigerians.The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) apathetically issues licences to independent petroleum marketers to import diesel from Europe with a weak naira and torment Nigerian consumers with high energy cost that escalates the country's catastrophic inflationary trend.When newsmen confronted the agency on the illogicality of encouraging diesel imports when a Nigerian refinery is ready to supply, NMDPRA retorted that in a deregulated market, marketers are free to source diesel from anywhere.NMDPRA is the regulatory arm of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL). The company is more or less an appendage of the mischievous international oil companies battling to protect the interest of European crude oil refiners patronised by NNPCL.NNPCL, as industry regulator, could order the deceitful IOCs to sell crude oil to Dangote Refinery at international market price. But it could only do so to the detriment of its own selfish interest.NNPCL would lose trillions of naira if Dangote Refinery gets crude oil from Nigeria and sells refined petroleum products locally at reduced pump prices.That would mean the end of the petrol subsidy scandal through which the company rakes in trillions of naira annually. That explains why NNPCL allows foreign exploiters to frustrate Dangote Refinery.NNPCL has unrestrained powers to supply crude oil to Dangote Refinery which at the moment is the only way to ease the asphyxiating hold of high energy cost on Nigeria's economy.If the treacherous IOCs defy NNPCL's directive to supply crude oil to Dangote Refinery at international market rate, the company could do the job by itself.NNPCL allocates 445,000 barrels of crude oil daily to Nigeria's moribund refineries. Nigeria's four refineries have not refined a barrel of crude oil in the last three years.Consequently, NNPCL exports the 445,000 barrels of crude oil daily to foreign refineries that feed Nigeria with refined petroleum products in return. If NNPCL reroutes the crude oil to Dangote Refinery, Nigeria would benefit extensively.The foreign refineries use the residue of the crude oil supplied by NNPCL for their petrochemical products and export them to Nigeria. If Dangote Refinery gets the crude oil, the residue would be used to produce resins that would be used to ease the escalating cost of producing plastic containers in the soft drink and brewery industries.Besides, NNPCL owes Dangote Refinery the sum of $1.7 billion as part of the 20 per cent equity it bought. It was expected to pay back with 300,000 barrels of crude oil daily. Its refusal to supply borders on betrayal of trust.It is rather saddening that Mele Kyari, the man who navigated NNPCL through the horrendous petrol subsidy scandal and crude oil theft, is still its group managing director. The man should do the right thing.

Expand NGI's July Bidweek National Avg. climbed 40.0 cents month/month to $2.215/MMBtu. That was down from $2.560 a year earlier. Trading for the latest bidweek period spanned June 24-26. Weather conditions proved mostly hot across the southern two-thirds of the Lower 48 in that span. National Weather Service (NWS) forecasts call for more of the same through the first half of July, with the heat spreading further to the northern third of the country. NWS outlooks also repeatedly have predicted above-average national temperatures for the summer overall. \"The weather backdrop is simply bullish,\" Pinebrook Energy Advisors' Andy Huenefeld, managing partner, told NGI during bidweek. Several natural gas hubs in California and the Southwest, where scorching temperatures were widespread over the final days of June and forecasted to sizzle further in coming weeks, propelled the overall increase during bidweek. Those regions also are dependent in part on gas from the Permian Basin, where maintenance work amid pipeline constraints in June limited supplies flowing west. SoCal Citygate surged $1.335 month/month to average $3.055, and SoCal Border Avg. jumped $1.235 to $2.565. In the Southwest, KRGT Del Pool spiked $1.150 to $2.740, while El Paso S. Mainline/N. Baja rose $1.400 to $2.600. Futures prices, however, struggled in late June as traders fixated on rising production and robust inventories of gas stored underground. Production consistently held around 100 Bcf/d late last month, rising from spring lows in the mid-90s Bcf/d, according to Wood Mackenzie. The firm on Monday estimated output at 100 Bcf/d. At the same time, supplies in storage remained abundant. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported an injection of 52 Bcf for the week ended June 21. The increase boosted inventories to 3,097 Bcf and put stocks 21% above the five-year average of 2,569 Bcf. The futures market \"is a little bit in a wait-and-see mode, wanting to actually witness the July heat develop as forecasted,\" StoneX Financial Inc.'s Thomas Saal, senior vice president of energy, told NGI. \"Because if that heat doesn't come through, we're going to be sitting on a lot of gas.\" Futures Pressure On the final day of the latest bidweek period, the July Nymex natural gas futures contract rolled off the board with a 12.8-cent loss. It settled at $2.628 on that Wednesday, down 3% from the prior week's close. It had lost ground the previous week as well. The August contract moved to the front of the curve last Thursday and fell 6.0 cents in that session and another 8.4 cents the following day. On Monday, it settled at $2.478, down 12.3 cents. \"We remain focused on rising natural gas production in mid-summer as drillers return deferred supply to the market,\" said EBW Analytics Group's Eli Rubin, senior analyst. Any \"downturn in cooling demand could send gas tumbling.\" Still, Rubin noted the forecasts point to solid demand ahead, and on the storage front, the surplus to the five-year average has narrowed over the past two months. With the latest EIA print, the surfeit declined by two percentage points. It has been cut in half since topping 40% in March. If that continues alongside scorching mid-summer conditions, he said, futures could rally. \"In the most likely scenario, record July heat may reinforce support for gas prices, whittle down storage surpluses, and allow\" the August contract \"to rebound towards $3.00 in the near-to-medium term.\" Catalysts Ahead While rising production creates a bearish undercurrent to watch closely, Rubin also noted that several new LNG facilities are in the works along the Gulf Coast that could double liquefied natural gas demand before the end of this decade. The first of them could open later this year, launching the trend. Notably, in late June, Texas Eastern Transmission LP began feeding gas to a pending Venture Global LNG Inc. export terminal through Gator Express in Louisiana. The initial test volumes to Plaquemines LNG indicated the facility was on track \"to start exporting in late 2024,\" Wood Mackenzie analyst Nadeem Ahmed said. Rubin described the testing as \"a momentous\" for Venture Global LNG. \"The speed of the near-term ramp up at Plaquemines may offer sufficient demand for natural gas to ward off oversupply later this year,\" he said. Wood Mackenzie data showed gas flows to LNG export facilities at 12.5 Bcf on Monday, up from an average of 12 Bcf/d last week. In the near term, NWS forecasts showed hotter-than-normal high temperatures from the upper 80s to 100s canvassing large swaths of the country from the Southwest to the East Coast this week. \"The first week of July marks the approximate six weeks of the year that typically bring the hottest conditions to most of the nation,\" said AccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski. \"When temperatures exceed the historical average even by a few degrees this time of the year, the heat can be dangerous.\" For the second week of July, highs from the 80s to low 90s were expected to spread over northern markets, while temperatures in the upper 80s to 100s were predicted to remain prevalent throughout southern areas. That would mark a continuation from late June. Strong heat in the final week of the month was expected to result in a seasonally light storage injection with the next EIA report on Wednesday - a day earlier than usual this week because of the Fourth of July holiday on Thursday. Preliminary injection estimates submitted to Reuters for the week ended June 28 ranged from 13 Bcf to 76 Bcf, with an average of 41 Bcf. NGI modeled a build of 29 Bcf. That compares with a five-year average increase of 69 Bcf. With those bullish factors in play, NGI's Patrick Rau, senior vice president of Research & Analysis, said Monday that futures were \"well into oversold territory now.\" However, he added, since the August contract fell below $2.50, \"there could be some follow-on selling down toward the next technical support level in the $2.40 range.\" Related Tags natural gas production weather Kevin Dobbs Kevin Dobbs joined the staff of NGI in April 2020.

    "Content": "OPEC: Global crude oil demand will rise to 116m bpd in 2045 - TV360 Nigeria The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) says world demand for oil is projected to rise to an estimated 116 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2045. Haitham Al Ghais, OPEC secretary-general, spoke on Tuesday in Abuja at the ongoing 23rd Nigerian Oil and Gas (NOG) Energy Week Conference and Exhibition. The conference is themed 'Showcasing Opportunities, Driving Investment, Meeting Energy Demand'. Addressing the conference via teleconference, Al Ghais said the world economy is expected to double in size - growing from $138 trillion in 2023 to $270 trillion in 2045. He explained that the oil cartel forecasted a rapidly expanding world population that would surpass 9.5 billion people. \"Why are we optimistic? Let us consider these statistics, which are based on OPEC's World Oil Outlook,\" he said. \"Urbanisation alone will account for over half a billion people moving to cities around the world by 2030. Al Ghais said in the upcoming years, the industry will need to significantly increase investment levels in order to keep up with the rapid and robust growth in energy consumption. He said according to its research, the total oil-related investment requirements between 2024 and 2045 would be $14 trillion or about $610 billion on average per year. \"Securing this vital funding is essential to maintaining security of supply and avoiding unwanted volatility,\" Al Ghais said. \"In spite of these facts, I am certain you are aware of some recent predictions for peak demand by 2030 and calls for a discontinuation of investment in hydrocarbons.\" Al Ghais pledged that OPEC and its member countries would keep pushing to advocate for a fair process for adaptation, mitigation and means of implementation with regard to climate finance and technology. The secretary-general said an estimated 675 million people lack access to basic forms of energy and 2.3 billion without access to clean cooking fuels. Al Ghais, while commending President Bola Tinubu, appreciated Nigeria's unwavering commitment to OPEC and the declaration of cooperation (DoC).
