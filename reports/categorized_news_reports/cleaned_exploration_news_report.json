Donate           07.02.24   Federal Bills Call for Damaging Funding Cuts and Harmful Offshore Drilling   By Katie Day              Each year, Congress must draft and agree upon a budget to fund the federal government. The intent of these appropriation bills is to provide funding that federal agencies need to accomplish their mandates and fund important programs. However, the first round of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 budget bills to pass out of House Committees last week are riddled with extensive budget cuts to ocean and coastal management programs that the public rely on for clean water and healthy beaches. The bills also include harmful policy provisions, known as \u201cpolicy riders\u201d, that have no business being in a budget bill!  Some of the most concerning policy riders in the House Fiscal Year 2025 budget bills include  mandates for new oil and gas leasing, prohibitions on the establishment of important protected areas for wildlife and natural ecosystems , and  limitations that hinder federal agency ability to regulate polluters ; putting water quality, air quality, and the climate at risk. For decades, Surfrider has fought to protect annual funding levels for important ocean and coastal programs. These include programs to support ocean research, protect ocean and coastal habitats, help communities prepare for coastal hazards, test water quality to keep people safe at the beach, and more. Two of the key federal agencies that administer these programs are the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), yet the House budget bills call for a  20 percent funding cut to the EPA , and a  12 percent funding cut to NOAA . While this is a very concerning way to start off the 2025 appropriations process, all is not lost.   Your voice can make a difference!   Click here to contact your federal representatives  and urge them to oppose these funding cuts and dangerous policy riders in order to protect communities, wildlife, the environment, and our ocean and coasts!  FY 2025 House Appropriation Bills: The Bad   Coastal water quality at risk to more sewage spills.  Funding levels for each program administered by the EPA have yet to be released, but a reduction in topline funding of 20 percent (not accounting for inflation!) does not bode well for EPA programs that are critical for protecting water quality, coastlines, and beachgoers in light of increasing climate change impacts. For instance, the  Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations bill  allocates just $1.2 billion to the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, roughly one third of the authorized level. Accounting for the hefty earmarks to specific projects, that\u2019s just $649 million to the actual fund, which is a  critical EPA program  that states rely on to fund wastewater infrastructure upgrades in order to prevent sewage spills.    Ocean ecosystems, community resilience, and coastal hazard preparedness threatened.  The  Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations bill  cuts funding to NOAA by 12 percent. While we don\u2019t have all the details of funding levels for each NOAA-administered program just yet, a notable topline funding cut means important programs like Coastal Zone Management, Sea Grant, Marine Sanctuaries and Protected Areas, and more could be at risk. These programs are designed to fund ocean and coastal research that keep communities safe, enhance coastal resilience, and help prepare against severe weather events.    Marine wildlife and coastal communities exposed to dangerous offshore oil and gas drilling.   Offshore oil and gas drilling  exacerbates climate change by producing fossil fuels, pollutes coastal waters with heavy metals and chemicals, and ultimately results in heart-wrenching oil spills that harm marine wildlife and coastal communities. The Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations bill includes requirements for new oil and gas lease sales and limits much needed protections for marine mammals from harm caused by offshore energy leasing.    Protections limited for at risk wildlife and ecosystems.  The Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations bill stops the Biden Administration\u2019s effort to protect 30 percent of our nation\u2019s lands and waters by 2030, known as the 30x30 Initiative, and weakens the Endangered Species Act.    The nation\u2019s ability to regulate polluters and respond to the climate crisis hindered.  The Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations bill blocks the EPA from enforcing the recently established methane fee on fossil fuel producers and prevents federal agencies from accounting for climate change impacts by blocking the use of the Social Cost of Carbon in cost benefit analyses. The bill also removes the ability of the National Environmental Protection Act to require the consideration of climate change efforts in permitting. Finally, the bill minimizes the ability of agencies to oversee and limit pollution from chemical and pesticide manufacturers.    National environmental justice initiatives blocked.  The Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations bill defunds important environmental justice programs, including the American Climate Corps, Climate Justice Alliance, and eco grief counseling. The bill also prohibits the Biden Administration\u2019s executive orders on diversity, equity, and inclusion from being implemented.   FY 2025 House Appropriation Bills: The Hopeful   Funding to address to the Tijuana River Valley water quality and environmental justice crisis.  The  State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations bill  includes record funding for the International Boundary and Water Commission, which will support essential maintenance and infrastructure upgrades at the International Wastewater Treatment plant at the US/Mexico border. This is a  priority campaign  for the Surfrider Foundation and our San Diego Chapter.    Full funding to the Land and Water Conservation Fund . While permanent, full funding to the Land and Water Conservation Fund is required thanks to the Great Americans Outdoors Act (a bill  Surfrider helped pass  in 2020!), last year millions of dollars were \u201crescinded\u201d from the program during the appropriations process. We\u2019re grateful to see House Committee members include full funding to this important program.    There are still many steps to go before becoming final!  These bills have only passed their various House Committees. Each of these appropriation bills will also need to be voted on by the full House of Representatives and confer with the Senate before the budget is finalized. The Senate versions are still in development but are expected to be more protective of funding levels and not include these harmful policy riders.    The fight isn\u2019t over.  Surfrider will continue to fight back to get funding levels restored for critical ocean and coastal programs in the Fiscal Year 2025 budget. Surfrider will also work diligently to prevent these harmful policy riders from becoming law.   Surfrider will continue to advocate for federal protections, funding and support for our ocean and coasts.  From  hosting fly-ins to Washington, D.C . to arranging in district field visits so Congressmembers and their staff can see the issues first hand, to submitting testimony to Congressional Committees throughout the year; Surfrider will not stop until these funding levels are restored and dangerous policies are avoided.

The coalition stressed that the government\u2019s previous decision to halt consideration of these renewals sends a clear message that The Bahamas is shifting away from fossil fuels and embracing a sustainable energy future. Challenger Energy Group, formerly known as The Bahamas Petroleum Company (BPC), continues its efforts to secure the renewal of its licenses for a third three-year exploration period. The company is currently engaged in ongoing discussions with the Government regarding the renewal terms. Eytan Uliel, Chief Executive of Challenger Energy, noted in the company\u2019s 2023 annual report and financial statement: \u201cIn relation to the Company\u2019s licenses in The Bahamas, throughout 2023 we continued to pursue a renewal of the licenses into a third exploration period. In parallel, we explored various alternative strategies to monetize those assets. The process has been frustratingly slow, but we expect to make better progress in the coming 12 months.\u201d The report also noted that under its Bahamian exploration licenses, the company must pay the government in advance for annual rentals in the licensed areas. Following the Environmental Authorization for the Perseverance-1 well on February 27, 2020, discussions between the company and the Government of The Bahamas seeking a final agreement on the amount of license fees payable for the remainder of the second exploration period (including the extension due to force majeure) have lacked substantive progress to date. \u201cThe fact that the government has not renewed or considered these licenses is a positive indication that The Bahamas is looking toward a cleaner, greener future,\u201d said Andurah Daxon, Executive Director of Waterkeepers Bahamas. \u201cWe cannot afford to jeopardize our marine environment and coastal ecosystems for uncertain oil prospects.\u201d Earlier this year, OIOF commissioned a nationwide poll revealing overwhelming public support for a permanent ban on oil drilling in Bahamian waters. The extensive survey showed that 86 percent of respondents support legislative action to prevent further fossil fuel exploration, with 74 percent advocating for a transition to renewable energy. Of the more than 400 respondents, only four percent opposed a ban on oil drilling, and nine percent were undecided. \u201cThe Bahamian people have spoken loud and clear. They want to protect our pristine waters and vibrant marine life, which are the lifeblood of our tourism and fishing industries,\u201d said Casuarina McKinney-Lambert, Executive Director of the Bahamas Reef Environment Educational Foundation (BREEF). \u201cThe path forward for the Bahamas is not through fossil fuels but through sustainable energy solutions. The recent oil spill off Clifton underscores the urgency to clean up existing sources of marine pollution and transition to a renewable future.\u201d According to OIOF, the exploration licenses referenced in Challenger Energy Group\u2019s 2023 annual report expired in 2021, and based on available information, the company still owes government fees associated with those licenses. Therefore, the groups emphasize that it is dangerously misleading to state, \u201cChallenger Energy holds four exploration licenses offshore in The Bahamas.\u201d This discrepancy further underscores the need for the government to take decisive action and permanently deny these renewal requests. \u201cThe government\u2019s refusal to consider renewal based on non-payment of license fees was an important step, and three years have now gone by since those licenses expired,\u201d said Chris Wilke of Waterkeeper Alliance. \u201cWith Challenger still knocking at the door, a permanent ban on oil drilling would provide the strongest possible assurance of the Bahamian commitment to safeguarding the marine environment and embracing a clean energy future.\u201d OIOF asserts that The Bahamas has a unique opportunity to lead the Caribbean region to reject dirty fossil fuel proliferation, transition to renewable energy, and set an example for sustainable development and environmental stewardship. OIOF urges the government to prioritize the long-term health and prosperity of the nation by formally denying exploration renewal requests, rejecting any further oil exploration licenses, and committing to a future powered by clean, renewable energy.

The three new island rigs will operate on existing and newly constructed innovative artificial islands at the offshore Zakum field for drilling and completion of wells. The rigs, which will be constructed by Honghua Group (HH), will incorporate industry leading technology and automation. Delivery of the rigs and commencement of operations is expected during 2026. The rigs will be designed and built as part of a partnership between ADNOC Drilling and HH. This partnership has been specifically formed to harness the transformative nature of AI, digitization, and advanced technology in the design and operation of these next generation drilling rigs. ADNOC Drilling and HH will look to also collaborate with AIQ, an Abu Dhabi based artificial intelligence (AI) pioneer contributing to the energy sector globally. The design of the rig operating systems will look to utilize real-time condition, performance and utilization data to create actionable insights, enhancing rig performance and increasing efficiency, leading to improvements in safety and well delivery times. Additionally, drilling operations on ADNOC\u2019s innovative artificial islands create the ideal conditions for extended reach drilling (ERD) with the top five longest wells in the world being delivered from these islands off the coast of Abu Dhabi, the most recently delivered being over 52,000 feet.  The rigs will be built to deliver ERD as well as having the state-of-the-art capability of walking between wells eliminating the need for the rigs to be dismantled to be moved. These capabilities dramatically improve efficiency and safety while vastly reducing costs and emissions. The ADNOC Drilling fleet is now expected to total at least 148 by 2026, including these three new rigs, as well as the previously announced three land rigs for the initial phase of unconventional development. Abdulrahman Abdulla Al Seiari, Chief Executive Officer of ADNOC Drilling, said, \u201cADNOC Drilling is honored to receive this substantial award, which marks a significant milestone in our company\u2019s accelerated growth journey. These new island rigs will be the most advanced in the world, embracing artificial intelligence, the most transformative technology of our generation. \u201cOur partnership with HH will amplify the creativity and ingenuity of our industry as we design and build these rigs of the future that drive efficiency and safety and deliver exceptional value for our customer ADNOC Offshore.\u201d Commenting on the award, Tayba Abdul Rahim Al Hashemi, Chief Executive Officer of ADNOC Offshore, said: \u201cADNOC Drilling\u2019s technical expertise and enhanced capabilities are key enablers as we safely and sustainably accelerate to meet the world\u2019s growing energy demands. This award will strengthen our partnership in the future as we work together to harness AI and innovation to maximise energy, minimize emissions and unlock significant value for stakeholders.\u201d                   \u00a92024 World Oil, \u00a9 2024 Gulf Publishing Company LLC.

GoldSilverBase MetalsCritical Metals    Source: Couloir Capital (7/3/24)   Metallic Minerals Corp. (MMG:TSX.V; MMNGF:OTCQB) recently announced its maiden NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate (MRE) at the Keno Silver project and the initiation of its 2024 drilling program, according to a Couloir Capital report.    Couloir Capital, in a research report published on June 29, 2024, provided an update on Metallic Minerals Corp. (MMG:TSX.V; MMNGF:OTCQB) following the company's announcement of its maiden NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate (MRE) at the Keno Silver project and the initiation of its 2024 drilling program. Metallic Minerals announced its first NI 43-101 MRE at the Keno Silver project, comprising four separate deposits (Formo, Fox, Caribou, and Homestake). \"The resource comprises an inferred resource of 2.5 Mt at 223 [grams per tonne silver equivalent] g/t AgEq, equating to 18.16 Moz of contained AgEq,\" Couloir Capital noted. \"These deposits remain open to lateral and depth expansion. We expect further drilling to add more resources, which should lead to an increase in the valuation.\" The analysts highlighted the company's 2024 drilling program, which has been initiated at both the La Plata and Keno Silver projects. \"This drilling initiative seeks to expand existing resources and evaluate the potential for new discoveries at the highest-priority, drill-ready targets,\" they stated. At Keno Silver, the focus will be on resource expansion at the Formo target, while at La Plata, the initial focus is on extending higher-grade mineralization at the Allard resource area. Couloir Capital also noted the recent top-up financing from  Newmont Corp. (NEM:NYSE) , viewing it as a positive development. \"We are encouraged to see additional share purchases from Newmont Corp. Newmont exercised its 'top-up right' to buy additional shares of MMG to maintain its 9.5% stake in the company,\" the analysts commented. \"We see this as a vote of confidence by a tier-1 miner in MMG's resource potential.\" Couloir Capital's fair value per share estimate of Blackwolf was updated to CA$0.47, representing a projected upside of 61.08% from the price at the time of the report of CA$0.29. Metallic Minerals' strategic plans include continuing exploration and resource expansion at both the Keno Silver and La Plata projects, as well as earning royalty monies on alluvial gold claims at its Australia Creek property near Dawson City, Yukon. With a Buy rating and a fair value estimate of CA$0.47, Couloir Capital sees significant potential in Metallic Minerals as the company advances its exploration projects and continues to expand its resource base. The analysts expect the 2024 drilling program to \"add significant ounces to the existing resources,\" potentially driving further value for shareholders.

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - July 3, 2024) -  Nicola Mining Inc. (TSXV: NIM)  (the \" Company \" or \" Nicola \") is pleased to announce the completion of a 3D induced polarization survey (\" 3D IP Survey \"). Based on 3D IP Survey results the Company is in the process of commencing of its 2024 diamond drilling program (\" Program \") at the New Craigmont Copper Project (\" New Craigmont \"), situated approximately 11 kilometres from Merritt, BC and adjacent to Teck Resources Ltd.'s Highland Valley Copper, Canada's largest open-pit copper mine.As previously announced in the Company's Feb. 21, 2024 and May 13, 2024 news releases, Nicola engaged Dias Geophysical of Saskatoon, SK, to conduct a 3D IP Survey. This comprehensive survey aimed to better define two principal exploration areas: the MARB-CAS Zone and the West Craigmont Zone (Figure 1). Upon reviewing the data from the approximately 6.5 square kilometer survey, the Company has commenced its 2024 diamond drilling exploration program. Figure 1 . 2024 IP Survey AreasTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/4873/215275_f85b0bd1b41c7bd0_001full.jpgA significant resistivity anomaly appears in the western section of New Craigmont, near the Lornex Fault, via the Company's 2022 ZTEM Survey. This anomaly was confirmed and refined by the 2024 3D IP Survey. Additionally, the Survey detected chargeability anomalies on the edges of the resistivity anomaly within the area, and a potential structure trending ENE, which coincides with the strongest and largest chargeability anomaly. This resistivity high could represent a felsic intrusion, as was observed in outcrop, and the chargeability high could indicate peripheral sulphidation, likely enhanced along the potential structure. The 3D IP Survey has generated multiple drilling targets focusing on the chargeability anomalies within the West Craigmont Zone.The 3D IP Survey at MARB-CAS provided valuable information regarding the lithologies and appears to clearly delineate the contact between Nicola Group rocks and the Guichon Creek Batholith. The major chargeability anomalies are primarily confined within the Nicola Group rocks in the southern portion of the survey area, with some chargeability anomalies detected between the MARB and CAS MINFILE showings.Peter Espig, Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"The 3D IP Survey both confirmed and further defined key targets. Combining numerous geological and geophysical parameters, including bedrock mapping, airborne magnetic survey, and ZTEM survey with the 3D IP Survey gives us a great confidence to have a successful Program.\"A total of 5,000 m of core drilling is planned for the 2024 exploration program. Drilling will primarily be focused on the West Craigmont Zone initially, with the possibility of also drilling at MARB/CAS later in the summer (Figure 2).

The first diamond drilling in Rhosgobel Intrusion since 1995 aims to extend findings from historical drilling. Soil sampling and geological mapping are underway to explore high-potential zones south of the Blackjack deposit and the newly acquired Clear Creek claims. Previous exploration data indicates multiple gold targets with promising results, setting the stage for potentially significant discoveries.         Positive   Initiation of the 2024 exploration program at Clear Creek, including diamond drilling. First diamond drilling at Rhosgobel Intrusion since 1995 aims to extend historical gold findings. Integration of extensive historical datasets to accelerate new gold discoveries. Geochemical surveys and geological mapping to explore high-potential zones for gold deposits. Positive historical drilling results with significant gold intersections at multiple targets.       Negative   None of the historically reported assay results from Clear Creek have been verified by Sitka.           07/03/2024 - 08:30 AM   2024 exploration has begun on the newly acquired Clear Creek property First diamond drilling program ever to be completed on the Rhosgobel Intrusion since historical shallow reverse circulation drilling in 1995 to follow up on holes 95-15 which intersected 50.3 m of 1.07 g/t gold and 95-16 which intersected 67.1 m of 1.03 g/t gold with both holes ending in strong gold mineralization. Grid geochemistry currently underway to infill gaps to the south of the Blackjack deposit on the high potential Pukelman West intrusion and G2 zone on the newly acquired Clear Creek claims. Integration of newly acquired datasets (geological, geophysical, geochemical) with Sitka Gold data. Geological mapping and prospecting following up on the high grade G2 zone, Contact zone and other highly prospective gold targets.   VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / July 3, 2024 / Sitka Gold Corp. (\"Sitka\" or the \"Company\") (TSXV:SIG)(FSE:1RF)(OTCQB:SITKF)  is pleased to announce that it has expanded the planned 2024 exploration program at its contiguous, 431 square kilometre RC Gold Project (\"RC Gold\" or the \"Project\") in Yukon to include diamond drilling and additional soil geochemistry surveys, geological mapping, prospecting and data integration and analysis on its newly acquired Clear Creek property (\"Clear Creek\") claims that complete the consolidation of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex (see Figure 1). The Company is currently diamond drilling at RC Gold in conjunction with a planned 15,000 metre drilling program for 2024. \"The accumulation of data from several years of systematic exploration by previous operators on the newly acquired Clear Creek Property has generated several high-quality exploration targets,\"  said Cor Coe, Director and CEO of Sitka Gold.  \"The newly acquired claims cover at least three intrusion related gold targets that are geologically similar to our developing Blackjack gold deposit and the team is very excited to begin assessing the property by testing the Rhosgobel intrusion, where historical work strongly indicates the potential for the presence of a multi-million ounce gold deposit. Sitka's initial discovery of the Blackjack and Eiger gold deposits came about through a similar process of review and compilation of a large historical database and we see the ability to accelerate the discovery of additional gold deposits by utilizing our growing knowledge of the intrusion-related gold systems in this area in conjunction with the comprehensive Clear Creek data-set as we continue our exploration activities across this emerging mining district.\" The newly consolidated Project includes four high-priority areas that have had previous reverse circulation and/or diamond drilling that require additional drilling. These areas are the Rhosgobel intrusion where historical drilling intersected up to  1.03 g/t gold over 67.1 m  , the Contact zone with drill results up to  20.3 g/t gold over 10.7 m  , the Bear Paw Breccia which intersected up to  1.87 g/t gold over 42.6 m  and the Pukelman intrusion with results of  1.20 g/t gold over 10.0 m  (see Figure 2, Table 1). The first target area to be tested is the Rhosgobel Intrusion where shallow historical drilling in 1995 by Kennecott outlined a large area of intrusion related gold mineralization (see Figure 3). Previous drilling at Rhosgobel was limited to a vertical depth of approximately 60 metres. The gold mineralization observed at Rhosgobel is sheeted quartz veins hosted in a megacrystic quartz monzonite similar to the Blackjack deposit located 5 km to the north along the recently discovered Blackjack Mineralized Corridor. The first drill hole will be a step out to drill underneath the mineralized zone intersected in Holes 15 and 16 in shallow reverse circulation drilling (see Figure 4). This will be the first diamond drill hole ever drilled in the Rhosgobel intrusion. Geological interpretation of a steeply dipping mineralized zone is consistent with controls on mineralization observed elsewhere on the property.The Company has recently engaged GroundTruth Exploration to conduct grid based soil sampling in an area south of the Blackjack deposit where prospecting in 2015 identified a highly prospective area. The G2 zone was prospected in 2015 and 13 surface float samples were collected with a range of trace to  43.4 g/t gold  (see Figure 5) within mineralized intrusive and metasedimentary rocks. Three other samples returned values of  5.9, 7.2 and 13.6 g/t gold  . This area is located approximately 2 km south of the Blackjack gold deposit area, within the Blackjack Mineralized Corridor in proximity to the West Pukelman intrusion. Previous reconnaissance scale soil sampling encountered anomalous gold in soil in the area. The G2 zone is located approximately 1 km west of the Pukelman West intrusion within an extensional corridor containing both the Pukelman and Pukelman West intrusions and several previously reported lamprophyre dykes. The Pukelman West intrusion is located approximately 1.5 km south of the Blackjack deposit where recent drilling has intersected higher-grade mineralization associated with the N-S trending Blackjack fault. The intersection of these structural zones is interpreted by Sitka to be highly prospective for the discovery of additional gold mineralization.Prospecting in 2015 also focused on the Contact zone located at the southern margin of the Pukelman intrusion. Nineteen samples were collected ranging from trace to  166.2 g/t gold  . Seven additional samples of mainly quartz vein material taken from float and outcrop assayed above 1.0 g/t gold including  86.0, 31.8, 47.2, 27.4, 18.1, 2.8, and 1.5 g/t gold  (see Figure 5). The sampling indicates that the extent of the Contact zone could be much larger than the area previously drilled. Additional mapping and prospecting is planned to refine drill targets in anticipation of drilling this area.Geological mapping and prospecting in the G2 to Pukelman West corridor and along the Blackjack fault mineralized corridor from the Blackjack deposit south through the Pukelman West and Rhosgobel intrusion for additional areas of undiscovered gold mineralization will also be conducted with the goal of identifying additional drill targets.Recently acquired data encompassing the southern portion of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex is being integrated within the Sitka database and plans for drilling additional known areas of mineralization are being developed.  Figure 1 -  The acquisition of the Clear Creek property now completes Sitka Gold's 100% ownership of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex and adds several underexplored areas that have strong potential for new gold discoveries in addition to four high-quality drill targets.   Figure 2 -  The purchase of the Clear Creek Property (outlined in yellow boundary) now completes Sitka Gold's ownership of 100% of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex, an area of approximately  8 km x 15 km  that includes several known surface intrusions with associated gold mineralization. The newly acquired property contains four highly prospective areas with limited historical drilling and several areas that have produced high-grade surface samples but remain under-explored and undrilled.   Figure 3 -  Shallow reverse circulation drilling in the Rhosgobel intrusion in 1995 produced numerous intersections of gold mineralization consisting of sheeted quartz veins with megacrystic quartz monzonite. Holes 15 and 16 were drilled in opposite directions at 60 degrees dip intersected mineralization over their entire lengths. The holes intersected  50.3 m grading 1.07 g/t gold  and  67.1m of 1.03 g/t gold  respectively with both holes ending in mineralization.   Figure 4  -  Cross-section of previous drilling at Rhosgobel along holes 15 and 16 which ended in mineralization. The first ever diamond drill hole proposed in the Rhosgobel intrusion (PROS-24-A) will step back and drill underneath holes 15 and 16 to test the width of the mineralized zone intersected in 1995.   Figure 5  -  Prospecting in 2015 was conducted in the G2 zone and the Contact Zone and produced many high-grade results. Additional grid soil sampling (shown in Figure 2) will be conducted in these areas and south where previous soil sampling has been conducted at only wide spacings. Current drilling is expanding the Blackjack deposit to the south towards this highly prospective area.

About the Flagship RC Gold Project The RC Gold Project consists of a 431 square kilometre contiguous district-scale land package located in the heart of Yukon's Tombstone Gold Belt. The project is located approximately 100 kilometres east of Dawson City, which has a 5,000 foot paved runway, and is accessed via a secondary gravel road from the Klondike Highway which is usable year-round and is an approximate 2 hour drive from Dawson City. It is the largest consolidated land package strategically positioned mid-way between Victoria Gold's Eagle Gold Mine - Yukon's newest gold mine which reached commercial production in the summer of 2020 - and Victoria Gold's former producing Brewery Creek Gold Mine.On January 19, 2023 Sitka Gold announced an Initial Mineral Resource Estimate prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\") guidelines for the RC Gold Property of  1,340,000  ounces of gold  (1)  . The road accessible, pit constrained Mineral Resource is classified as inferred and is contained in two zones: The Blackjack and Eiger deposits. Both of these deposits are at/near surface, are potentially open pit minable and amenable to heap leaching, with initial bottle roll tests indicating that the gold is not refractory and has  high gold recoveries of up to 94%  with minimal NaCN consumption (see News Release July 13, 2022). The Mineral Resource estimate is presented in the following table at a base case cut-off grade of 0.25 g/t Au: RC Gold Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate COG g/t Au Blackjack Zone   Eiger Zone   Combined Tonnes 000's Au g/t 0z Au 000's   Tonnes 000's Au g/t 0z Au 000's   Tonnes 000's Au g/t 0z Au 000's 0.2035,7980.80921 32,5230.45471 68,3210.631,391 0.25 33,743 0.83 900   27,362 0.50 440   61,105 0.68 1,340 0.3031,2820.88885 22,2530.55393 53,5350.741,2790.3529,0650.92860 17,8170.60344 46,8820.801,2030.4026,9750.96833 14,5060.66308 41,4810.861,140Notes  Mineral resource estimate prepared by Ronald G. Simpson of GeoSim Services Inc. with an effective date of January 19, 2023. Mineral Resources are classified using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards.  The cut-off grade of 0.25 g/t Au is believed to provide a reasonable margin over operating and sustaining costs for open-pit mining and processing  Mineral resources are constrained by an optimised pit shell using the following assumptions: US $1800/oz Au price; a 45\u00b0 pit slope; assumed metallurgical recovery of 85%; mining costs of US$2.00 per tonne; processing costs of US$8.00 per tonne; G&A of US$1.50/t. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.  Totals may not sum due to rounding.  To date, 56 diamond drill holes have been drilled into this system for a total of approximately 19,962 metres including 16 drill holes totalling 6,515 metres completed in 2023 focused on expanding the initial resource. The drilling in 2023 produced results of up to  219.0 m of 1.34 g/t gold  including  124.8 m of 2.01 g/t gold  and  55.0 m of 3.11 g/t gold  in drill hole DDRCCC-23-047 at Blackjack (see news release dated September 26, 2023). The Company is currently diamond drilling at RC Gold in conjunction with a planned 15,000 metre drilling program.  Simpson, R. January 19, 2023.

The survey, conducted by Dias Geophysical, covered approximately 6.5 square kilometers and focused on the MARB-CAS and West Craigmont Zones. Key findings include significant resistivity and chargeability anomalies that indicate potential copper-rich areas. Based on these results, Nicola has commenced its 2024 diamond drilling program, targeting 5,000 meters of core drilling. Initial drilling will focus on the West Craigmont Zone, with possible expansion to the MARB/CAS areas later in the summer.         Positive   None.       Negative   None.           07/03/2024 - 09:00 AM  Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - July 3, 2024) -  Nicola Mining Inc. (TSXV: NIM)  (the \" Company \" or \" Nicola \") is pleased to announce the completion of a 3D induced polarization survey (\" 3D IP Survey \"). Based on 3D IP Survey results the Company is in the process of commencing of its 2024 diamond drilling program (\" Program \") at the New Craigmont Copper Project (\" New Craigmont \"), situated approximately 11 kilometres from Merritt, BC and adjacent to Teck Resources Ltd.'s Highland Valley Copper, Canada's largest open-pit copper mine.As previously announced in the Company's Feb. 21, 2024 and May 13, 2024 news releases, Nicola engaged Dias Geophysical of Saskatoon, SK, to conduct a 3D IP Survey. This comprehensive survey aimed to better define two principal exploration areas: the MARB-CAS Zone and the West Craigmont Zone (Figure 1). Upon reviewing the data from the approximately 6.5 square kilometer survey, the Company has commenced its 2024 diamond drilling exploration program. Figure 1 . 2024 IP Survey AreasTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/4873/215275_f85b0bd1b41c7bd0_001full.jpgA significant resistivity anomaly appears in the western section of New Craigmont, near the Lornex Fault, via the Company's 2022 ZTEM Survey. This anomaly was confirmed and refined by the 2024 3D IP Survey. Additionally, the Survey detected chargeability anomalies on the edges of the resistivity anomaly within the area, and a potential structure trending ENE, which coincides with the strongest and largest chargeability anomaly. This resistivity high could represent a felsic intrusion, as was observed in outcrop, and the chargeability high could indicate peripheral sulphidation, likely enhanced along the potential structure. The 3D IP Survey has generated multiple drilling targets focusing on the chargeability anomalies within the West Craigmont Zone.The 3D IP Survey at MARB-CAS provided valuable information regarding the lithologies and appears to clearly delineate the contact between Nicola Group rocks and the Guichon Creek Batholith. The major chargeability anomalies are primarily confined within the Nicola Group rocks in the southern portion of the survey area, with some chargeability anomalies detected between the MARB and CAS MINFILE showings.Peter Espig, Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"The 3D IP Survey both confirmed and further defined key targets. Combining numerous geological and geophysical parameters, including bedrock mapping, airborne magnetic survey, and ZTEM survey with the 3D IP Survey gives us a great confidence to have a successful Program.\"A total of 5,000 m of core drilling is planned for the 2024 exploration program. Drilling will primarily be focused on the West Craigmont Zone initially, with the possibility of also drilling at MARB/CAS later in the summer (Figure 2).

Grid geochemistry currently underway to infill gaps to the south of the Blackjack deposit on the high potential Pukelman West intrusion and G2 zone on the newly acquired Clear Creek claims. Integration of newly acquired datasets (geological, geophysical, geochemical) with Sitka Gold data. Geological mapping and prospecting following up on the high grade G2 zone, Contact zone and other highly prospective gold targets. VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / July 3, 2024 / Sitka Gold Corp. (\"Sitka\" or the \"Company\") (TSXV:SIG)(FSE:1RF)(OTCQB:SITKF)  is pleased to announce that it has expanded the planned 2024 exploration program at its contiguous, 431 square kilometre RC Gold Project (\"RC Gold\" or the \"Project\") in Yukon to include diamond drilling and additional soil geochemistry surveys, geological mapping, prospecting and data integration and analysis on its newly acquired Clear Creek property (\"Clear Creek\") claims that complete the consolidation of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex (see Figure 1). The Company is currently diamond drilling at RC Gold in conjunction with a planned 15,000 metre drilling program for 2024. \"The accumulation of data from several years of systematic exploration by previous operators on the newly acquired Clear Creek Property has generated several high-quality exploration targets,\"  said Cor Coe, Director and CEO of Sitka Gold.  \"The newly acquired claims cover at least three intrusion related gold targets that are geologically similar to our developing Blackjack gold deposit and the team is very excited to begin assessing the property by testing the Rhosgobel intrusion, where historical work strongly indicates the potential for the presence of a multi-million ounce gold deposit. Sitka's initial discovery of the Blackjack and Eiger gold deposits came about through a similar process of review and compilation of a large historical database and we see the ability to accelerate the discovery of additional gold deposits by utilizing our growing knowledge of the intrusion-related gold systems in this area in conjunction with the comprehensive Clear Creek data-set as we continue our exploration activities across this emerging mining district.\" Story continues The newly consolidated Project includes four high-priority areas that have had previous reverse circulation and/or diamond drilling that require additional drilling. These areas are the Rhosgobel intrusion where historical drilling intersected up to  1.03 g/t gold over 67.1 m  , the Contact zone with drill results up to  20.3 g/t gold over 10.7 m  , the Bear Paw Breccia which intersected up to  1.87 g/t gold over 42.6 m  and the Pukelman intrusion with results of  1.20 g/t gold over 10.0 m  (see Figure 2, Table 1). The first target area to be tested is the Rhosgobel Intrusion where shallow historical drilling in 1995 by Kennecott outlined a large area of intrusion related gold mineralization (see Figure 3). Previous drilling at Rhosgobel was limited to a vertical depth of approximately 60 metres. The gold mineralization observed at Rhosgobel is sheeted quartz veins hosted in a megacrystic quartz monzonite similar to the Blackjack deposit located 5 km to the north along the recently discovered Blackjack Mineralized Corridor. The first drill hole will be a step out to drill underneath the mineralized zone intersected in Holes 15 and 16 in shallow reverse circulation drilling (see Figure 4). This will be the first diamond drill hole ever drilled in the Rhosgobel intrusion. Geological interpretation of a steeply dipping mineralized zone is consistent with controls on mineralization observed elsewhere on the property.The Company has recently engaged GroundTruth Exploration to conduct grid based soil sampling in an area south of the Blackjack deposit where prospecting in 2015 identified a highly prospective area. The G2 zone was prospected in 2015 and 13 surface float samples were collected with a range of trace to  43.4 g/t gold  (see Figure 5) within mineralized intrusive and metasedimentary rocks. Three other samples returned values of  5.9, 7.2 and 13.6 g/t gold  . This area is located approximately 2 km south of the Blackjack gold deposit area, within the Blackjack Mineralized Corridor in proximity to the West Pukelman intrusion. Previous reconnaissance scale soil sampling encountered anomalous gold in soil in the area. The G2 zone is located approximately 1 km west of the Pukelman West intrusion within an extensional corridor containing both the Pukelman and Pukelman West intrusions and several previously reported lamprophyre dykes. The Pukelman West intrusion is located approximately 1.5 km south of the Blackjack deposit where recent drilling has intersected higher-grade mineralization associated with the N-S trending Blackjack fault. The intersection of these structural zones is interpreted by Sitka to be highly prospective for the discovery of additional gold mineralization.Prospecting in 2015 also focused on the Contact zone located at the southern margin of the Pukelman intrusion. Nineteen samples were collected ranging from trace to  166.2 g/t gold  . Seven additional samples of mainly quartz vein material taken from float and outcrop assayed above 1.0 g/t gold including  86.0, 31.8, 47.2, 27.4, 18.1, 2.8, and 1.5 g/t gold  (see Figure 5). The sampling indicates that the extent of the Contact zone could be much larger than the area previously drilled. Additional mapping and prospecting is planned to refine drill targets in anticipation of drilling this area.Geological mapping and prospecting in the G2 to Pukelman West corridor and along the Blackjack fault mineralized corridor from the Blackjack deposit south through the Pukelman West and Rhosgobel intrusion for additional areas of undiscovered gold mineralization will also be conducted with the goal of identifying additional drill targets.Recently acquired data encompassing the southern portion of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex is being integrated within the Sitka database and plans for drilling additional known areas of mineralization are being developed. Figure 1 -  The acquisition of the Clear Creek property now completes Sitka Gold's 100% ownership of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex and adds several underexplored areas that have strong potential for new gold discoveries in addition to four high-quality drill targets. Figure 2 -  The purchase of the Clear Creek Property (outlined in yellow boundary) now completes Sitka Gold's ownership of 100% of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex, an area of approximately  8 km x 15 km  that includes several known surface intrusions with associated gold mineralization. The newly acquired property contains four highly prospective areas with limited historical drilling and several areas that have produced high-grade surface samples but remain under-explored and undrilled. Figure 3 -  Shallow reverse circulation drilling in the Rhosgobel intrusion in 1995 produced numerous intersections of gold mineralization consisting of sheeted quartz veins with megacrystic quartz monzonite. Holes 15 and 16 were drilled in opposite directions at 60 degrees dip intersected mineralization over their entire lengths. The holes intersected  50.3 m grading 1.07 g/t gold  and  67.1m of 1.03 g/t gold  respectively with both holes ending in mineralization. Figure 4  -  Cross-section of previous drilling at Rhosgobel along holes 15 and 16 which ended in mineralization. The first ever diamond drill hole proposed in the Rhosgobel intrusion (PROS-24-A) will step back and drill underneath holes 15 and 16 to test the width of the mineralized zone intersected in 1995. Figure 5  -  Prospecting in 2015 was conducted in the G2 zone and the Contact Zone and produced many high-grade results. Additional grid soil sampling (shown in Figure 2) will be conducted in these areas and south where previous soil sampling has been conducted at only wide spacings. Current drilling is expanding the Blackjack deposit to the south towards this highly prospective area.

About the Flagship RC Gold Project The RC Gold Project consists of a 431 square kilometre contiguous district-scale land package located in the heart of Yukon's Tombstone Gold Belt. The project is located approximately 100 kilometres east of Dawson City, which has a 5,000 foot paved runway, and is accessed via a secondary gravel road from the Klondike Highway which is usable year-round and is an approximate 2 hour drive from Dawson City. It is the largest consolidated land package strategically positioned mid-way between Victoria Gold's Eagle Gold Mine - Yukon's newest gold mine which reached commercial production in the summer of 2020 - and Victoria Gold's former producing Brewery Creek Gold Mine.On January 19, 2023 Sitka Gold announced an Initial Mineral Resource Estimate prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\") guidelines for the RC Gold Property of  1,340,000  ounces of gold  (1)  . The road accessible, pit constrained Mineral Resource is classified as inferred and is contained in two zones: The Blackjack and Eiger deposits. Both of these deposits are at/near surface, are potentially open pit minable and amenable to heap leaching, with initial bottle roll tests indicating that the gold is not refractory and has  high gold recoveries of up to 94%  with minimal NaCN consumption (see News Release July 13, 2022). The Mineral Resource estimate is presented in the following table at a base case cut-off grade of 0.25 g/t Au: RC Gold Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate COG g/t Au Blackjack Zone Eiger Zone Combined Tonnes 000's Au g/t 0z Au 000's Tonnes 000's Au g/t 0z Au 000's Tonnes 000's Au g/t 0z Au 000's 0.2035,7980.8092132,5230.4547168,3210.631,391 0.25 33,743 0.83 900 27,362 0.50 440 61,105 0.68 1,340 0.3031,2820.8888522,2530.5539353,5350.741,2790.3529,0650.9286017,8170.6034446,8820.801,2030.4026,9750.9683314,5060.6630841,4810.861,140 Notes  Mineral resource estimate prepared by Ronald G. Simpson of GeoSim Services Inc. with an effective date of January 19, 2023. Mineral Resources are classified using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards.  The cut-off grade of 0.25 g/t Au is believed to provide a reasonable margin over operating and sustaining costs for open-pit mining and processing  Mineral resources are constrained by an optimised pit shell using the following assumptions: US$1800/oz Au price; a 45\u00b0 pit slope; assumed metallurgical recovery of 85%; mining costs of US$2.00 per tonne; processing costs of US$8.00 per tonne; G&A of US$1.50/t.  Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.  Totals may not sum due to rounding.  To date, 56 diamond drill holes have been drilled into this system for a total of approximately 19,962 metres including 16 drill holes totalling 6,515 metres completed in 2023 focused on expanding the initial resource. The drilling in 2023 produced results of up to  219.0 m of 1.34 g/t gold  including  124.8 m of 2.01 g/t gold  and  55.0 m of 3.11 g/t gold  in drill hole DDRCCC-23-047 at Blackjack (see news release dated September 26, 2023). The Company is currently diamond drilling at RC Gold in conjunction with a planned 15,000 metre drilling program.  Simpson, R. January 19, 2023.

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - July 3, 2024) -  Nicola Mining Inc. (TSXV: NIM)  (the \" Company \" or \" Nicola \") is pleased to announce the completion of a 3D induced polarization survey (\" 3D IP Survey \"). Based on 3D IP Survey results the Company is in the process of commencing of its 2024 diamond drilling program (\" Program \") at the New Craigmont Copper Project (\" New Craigmont \"), situated approximately 11 kilometres from Merritt, BC and adjacent to Teck Resources Ltd.'s Highland Valley Copper, Canada's largest open-pit copper mine.As previously announced in the Company's Feb. 21, 2024 and May 13, 2024 news releases, Nicola engaged Dias Geophysical of Saskatoon, SK, to conduct a 3D IP Survey. This comprehensive survey aimed to better define two principal exploration areas: the MARB-CAS Zone and the West Craigmont Zone (Figure 1). Upon reviewing the data from the approximately 6.5 square kilometer survey, the Company has commenced its 2024 diamond drilling exploration program. Figure 1 . 2024 IP Survey AreasTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/4873/215275_f85b0bd1b41c7bd0_001full.jpgA significant resistivity anomaly appears in the western section of New Craigmont, near the Lornex Fault, via the Company's 2022 ZTEM Survey. This anomaly was confirmed and refined by the 2024 3D IP Survey. Additionally, the Survey detected chargeability anomalies on the edges of the resistivity anomaly within the area, and a potential structure trending ENE, which coincides with the strongest and largest chargeability anomaly. This resistivity high could represent a felsic intrusion, as was observed in outcrop, and the chargeability high could indicate peripheral sulphidation, likely enhanced along the potential structure. The 3D IP Survey has generated multiple drilling targets focusing on the chargeability anomalies within the West Craigmont Zone.The 3D IP Survey at MARB-CAS provided valuable information regarding the lithologies and appears to clearly delineate the contact between Nicola Group rocks and the Guichon Creek Batholith. The major chargeability anomalies are primarily confined within the Nicola Group rocks in the southern portion of the survey area, with some chargeability anomalies detected between the MARB and CAS MINFILE showings.Peter Espig, Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"The 3D IP Survey both confirmed and further defined key targets. Combining numerous geological and geophysical parameters, including bedrock mapping, airborne magnetic survey, and ZTEM survey with the 3D IP Survey gives us a great confidence to have a successful Program.\"A total of 5,000 m of core drilling is planned for the 2024 exploration program.

Grid geochemistry currently underway to infill gaps to the south of the Blackjack deposit on the high potential Pukelman West intrusion and G2 zone on the newly acquired Clear Creek claims. Integration of newly acquired datasets (geological, geophysical, geochemical) with Sitka Gold data. Geological mapping and prospecting following up on the high grade G2 zone, Contact zone and other highly prospective gold targets. VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / July 3, 2024 / Sitka Gold Corp. (\"Sitka\" or the \"Company\") (TSXV:SIG)(FSE:1RF)(OTCQB:SITKF)  is pleased to announce that it has expanded the planned 2024 exploration program at its contiguous, 431 square kilometre RC Gold Project (\"RC Gold\" or the \"Project\") in Yukon to include diamond drilling and additional soil geochemistry surveys, geological mapping, prospecting and data integration and analysis on its newly acquired Clear Creek property (\"Clear Creek\") claims that complete the consolidation of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex (see Figure 1). The Company is currently diamond drilling at RC Gold in conjunction with a planned 15,000 metre drilling program for 2024. \"The accumulation of data from several years of systematic exploration by previous operators on the newly acquired Clear Creek Property has generated several high-quality exploration targets,\"  said Cor Coe, Director and CEO of Sitka Gold.  \"The newly acquired claims cover at least three intrusion related gold targets that are geologically similar to our developing Blackjack gold deposit and the team is very excited to begin assessing the property by testing the Rhosgobel intrusion, where historical work strongly indicates the potential for the presence of a multi-million ounce gold deposit. Sitka's initial discovery of the Blackjack and Eiger gold deposits came about through a similar process of review and compilation of a large historical database and we see the ability to accelerate the discovery of additional gold deposits by utilizing our growing knowledge of the intrusion-related gold systems in this area in conjunction with the comprehensive Clear Creek data-set as we continue our exploration activities across this emerging mining district.\" Story continues The newly consolidated Project includes four high-priority areas that have had previous reverse circulation and/or diamond drilling that require additional drilling. These areas are the Rhosgobel intrusion where historical drilling intersected up to  1.03 g/t gold over 67.1 m  , the Contact zone with drill results up to  20.3 g/t gold over 10.7 m  , the Bear Paw Breccia which intersected up to  1.87 g/t gold over 42.6 m  and the Pukelman intrusion with results of  1.20 g/t gold over 10.0 m  (see Figure 2, Table 1). The first target area to be tested is the Rhosgobel Intrusion where shallow historical drilling in 1995 by Kennecott outlined a large area of intrusion related gold mineralization (see Figure 3). Previous drilling at Rhosgobel was limited to a vertical depth of approximately 60 metres. The gold mineralization observed at Rhosgobel is sheeted quartz veins hosted in a megacrystic quartz monzonite similar to the Blackjack deposit located 5 km to the north along the recently discovered Blackjack Mineralized Corridor. The first drill hole will be a step out to drill underneath the mineralized zone intersected in Holes 15 and 16 in shallow reverse circulation drilling (see Figure 4). This will be the first diamond drill hole ever drilled in the Rhosgobel intrusion. Geological interpretation of a steeply dipping mineralized zone is consistent with controls on mineralization observed elsewhere on the property.The Company has recently engaged GroundTruth Exploration to conduct grid based soil sampling in an area south of the Blackjack deposit where prospecting in 2015 identified a highly prospective area. The G2 zone was prospected in 2015 and 13 surface float samples were collected with a range of trace to  43.4 g/t gold  (see Figure 5) within mineralized intrusive and metasedimentary rocks. Three other samples returned values of  5.9, 7.2 and 13.6 g/t gold  . This area is located approximately 2 km south of the Blackjack gold deposit area, within the Blackjack Mineralized Corridor in proximity to the West Pukelman intrusion. Previous reconnaissance scale soil sampling encountered anomalous gold in soil in the area. The G2 zone is located approximately 1 km west of the Pukelman West intrusion within an extensional corridor containing both the Pukelman and Pukelman West intrusions and several previously reported lamprophyre dykes. The Pukelman West intrusion is located approximately 1.5 km south of the Blackjack deposit where recent drilling has intersected higher-grade mineralization associated with the N-S trending Blackjack fault. The intersection of these structural zones is interpreted by Sitka to be highly prospective for the discovery of additional gold mineralization.Prospecting in 2015 also focused on the Contact zone located at the southern margin of the Pukelman intrusion. Nineteen samples were collected ranging from trace to  166.2 g/t gold  . Seven additional samples of mainly quartz vein material taken from float and outcrop assayed above 1.0 g/t gold including  86.0, 31.8, 47.2, 27.4, 18.1, 2.8, and 1.5 g/t gold  (see Figure 5). The sampling indicates that the extent of the Contact zone could be much larger than the area previously drilled. Additional mapping and prospecting is planned to refine drill targets in anticipation of drilling this area.Geological mapping and prospecting in the G2 to Pukelman West corridor and along the Blackjack fault mineralized corridor from the Blackjack deposit south through the Pukelman West and Rhosgobel intrusion for additional areas of undiscovered gold mineralization will also be conducted with the goal of identifying additional drill targets.Recently acquired data encompassing the southern portion of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex is being integrated within the Sitka database and plans for drilling additional known areas of mineralization are being developed. Figure 1 -  The acquisition of the Clear Creek property now completes Sitka Gold's 100% ownership of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex and adds several underexplored areas that have strong potential for new gold discoveries in addition to four high-quality drill targets. Figure 2 -  The purchase of the Clear Creek Property (outlined in yellow boundary) now completes Sitka Gold's ownership of 100% of the Clear Creek Intrusive Complex, an area of approximately  8 km x 15 km  that includes several known surface intrusions with associated gold mineralization. The newly acquired property contains four highly prospective areas with limited historical drilling and several areas that have produced high-grade surface samples but remain under-explored and undrilled. Figure 3 -  Shallow reverse circulation drilling in the Rhosgobel intrusion in 1995 produced numerous intersections of gold mineralization consisting of sheeted quartz veins with megacrystic quartz monzonite. Holes 15 and 16 were drilled in opposite directions at 60 degrees dip intersected mineralization over their entire lengths. The holes intersected  50.3 m grading 1.07 g/t gold  and  67.1m of 1.03 g/t gold  respectively with both holes ending in mineralization. Figure 4  -  Cross-section of previous drilling at Rhosgobel along holes 15 and 16 which ended in mineralization. The first ever diamond drill hole proposed in the Rhosgobel intrusion (PROS-24-A) will step back and drill underneath holes 15 and 16 to test the width of the mineralized zone intersected in 1995. Figure 5  -  Prospecting in 2015 was conducted in the G2 zone and the Contact Zone and produced many high-grade results. Additional grid soil sampling (shown in Figure 2) will be conducted in these areas and south where previous soil sampling has been conducted at only wide spacings. Current drilling is expanding the Blackjack deposit to the south towards this highly prospective area.

About the Flagship RC Gold Project The RC Gold Project consists of a 431 square kilometre contiguous district-scale land package located in the heart of Yukon's Tombstone Gold Belt. The project is located approximately 100 kilometres east of Dawson City, which has a 5,000 foot paved runway, and is accessed via a secondary gravel road from the Klondike Highway which is usable year-round and is an approximate 2 hour drive from Dawson City. It is the largest consolidated land package strategically positioned mid-way between Victoria Gold's Eagle Gold Mine - Yukon's newest gold mine which reached commercial production in the summer of 2020 - and Victoria Gold's former producing Brewery Creek Gold Mine.On January 19, 2023 Sitka Gold announced an Initial Mineral Resource Estimate prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\") guidelines for the RC Gold Property of  1,340,000  ounces of gold  (1)  . The road accessible, pit constrained Mineral Resource is classified as inferred and is contained in two zones: The Blackjack and Eiger deposits. Both of these deposits are at/near surface, are potentially open pit minable and amenable to heap leaching, with initial bottle roll tests indicating that the gold is not refractory and has  high gold recoveries of up to 94%  with minimal NaCN consumption (see News Release July 13, 2022). The Mineral Resource estimate is presented in the following table at a base case cut-off grade of 0.25 g/t Au: RC Gold Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate COG g/t Au Blackjack Zone Eiger Zone Combined Tonnes 000's Au g/t 0z Au 000's Tonnes 000's Au g/t 0z Au 000's Tonnes 000's Au g/t 0z Au 000's 0.2035,7980.8092132,5230.4547168,3210.631,391 0.25 33,743 0.83 900 27,362 0.50 440 61,105 0.68 1,340 0.3031,2820.8888522,2530.5539353,5350.741,2790.3529,0650.9286017,8170.6034446,8820.801,2030.4026,9750.9683314,5060.6630841,4810.861,140 Notes  Mineral resource estimate prepared by Ronald G. Simpson of GeoSim Services Inc. with an effective date of January 19, 2023. Mineral Resources are classified using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards.  The cut-off grade of 0.25 g/t Au is believed to provide a reasonable margin over operating and sustaining costs for open-pit mining and processing  Mineral resources are constrained by an optimised pit shell using the following assumptions: US$1800/oz Au price; a 45\u00b0 pit slope; assumed metallurgical recovery of 85%; mining costs of US$2.00 per tonne; processing costs of US$8.00 per tonne; G&A of US$1.50/t.  Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.  Totals may not sum due to rounding.  To date, 56 diamond drill holes have been drilled into this system for a total of approximately 19,962 metres including 16 drill holes totalling 6,515 metres completed in 2023 focused on expanding the initial resource. The drilling in 2023 produced results of up to  219.0 m of 1.34 g/t gold  including  124.8 m of 2.01 g/t gold  and  55.0 m of 3.11 g/t gold  in drill hole DDRCCC-23-047 at Blackjack (see news release dated September 26, 2023). The Company is currently diamond drilling at RC Gold in conjunction with a planned 15,000 metre drilling program.  Simpson, R. January 19, 2023.

GoldSilverBase MetalsCritical Metals    Source: Couloir Capital (7/3/24)   Metallic Minerals Corp. (MMG:TSX.V; MMNGF:OTCQB) recently announced its maiden NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate (MRE) at the Keno Silver project and the initiation of its 2024 drilling program, according to a Couloir Capital report.    Couloir Capital, in a research report published on June 29, 2024, provided an update on Metallic Minerals Corp. (MMG:TSX.V; MMNGF:OTCQB) following the company's announcement of its maiden NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate (MRE) at the Keno Silver project and the initiation of its 2024 drilling program. Metallic Minerals announced its first NI 43-101 MRE at the Keno Silver project, comprising four separate deposits (Formo, Fox, Caribou, and Homestake). \"The resource comprises an inferred resource of 2.5 Mt at 223 [grams per tonne silver equivalent] g/t AgEq, equating to 18.16 Moz of contained AgEq,\" Couloir Capital noted. \"These deposits remain open to lateral and depth expansion. We expect further drilling to add more resources, which should lead to an increase in the valuation.\" The analysts highlighted the company's 2024 drilling program, which has been initiated at both the La Plata and Keno Silver projects. \"This drilling initiative seeks to expand existing resources and evaluate the potential for new discoveries at the highest-priority, drill-ready targets,\" they stated. At Keno Silver, the focus will be on resource expansion at the Formo target, while at La Plata, the initial focus is on extending higher-grade mineralization at the Allard resource area. Couloir Capital also noted the recent top-up financing from  Newmont Corp. (NEM:NYSE) , viewing it as a positive development. \"We are encouraged to see additional share purchases from Newmont Corp. Newmont exercised its 'top-up right' to buy additional shares of MMG to maintain its 9.5% stake in the company,\" the analysts commented. \"We see this as a vote of confidence by a tier-1 miner in MMG's resource potential.\" Couloir Capital's fair value per share estimate of Blackwolf was updated to CA$0.47, representing a projected upside of 61.08% from the price at the time of the report of CA$0.29. Metallic Minerals' strategic plans include continuing exploration and resource expansion at both the Keno Silver and La Plata projects, as well as earning royalty monies on alluvial gold claims at its Australia Creek property near Dawson City, Yukon. With a Buy rating and a fair value estimate of CA$0.47, Couloir Capital sees significant potential in Metallic Minerals as the company advances its exploration projects and continues to expand its resource base. The analysts expect the 2024 drilling program to \"add significant ounces to the existing resources,\" potentially driving further value for shareholders.

The survey, conducted by Dias Geophysical, covered approximately 6.5 square kilometers and focused on the MARB-CAS and West Craigmont Zones. Key findings include significant resistivity and chargeability anomalies that indicate potential copper-rich areas. Based on these results, Nicola has commenced its 2024 diamond drilling program, targeting 5,000 meters of core drilling. Initial drilling will focus on the West Craigmont Zone, with possible expansion to the MARB/CAS areas later in the summer.         Positive   None.       Negative   None.           07/03/2024 - 09:00 AM  Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - July 3, 2024) -  Nicola Mining Inc. (TSXV: NIM)  (the \" Company \" or \" Nicola \") is pleased to announce the completion of a 3D induced polarization survey (\" 3D IP Survey \"). Based on 3D IP Survey results the Company is in the process of commencing of its 2024 diamond drilling program (\" Program \") at the New Craigmont Copper Project (\" New Craigmont \"), situated approximately 11 kilometres from Merritt, BC and adjacent to Teck Resources Ltd.'s Highland Valley Copper, Canada's largest open-pit copper mine.As previously announced in the Company's Feb. 21, 2024 and May 13, 2024 news releases, Nicola engaged Dias Geophysical of Saskatoon, SK, to conduct a 3D IP Survey. This comprehensive survey aimed to better define two principal exploration areas: the MARB-CAS Zone and the West Craigmont Zone (Figure 1). Upon reviewing the data from the approximately 6.5 square kilometer survey, the Company has commenced its 2024 diamond drilling exploration program. Figure 1 . 2024 IP Survey AreasTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/4873/215275_f85b0bd1b41c7bd0_001full.jpgA significant resistivity anomaly appears in the western section of New Craigmont, near the Lornex Fault, via the Company's 2022 ZTEM Survey. This anomaly was confirmed and refined by the 2024 3D IP Survey. Additionally, the Survey detected chargeability anomalies on the edges of the resistivity anomaly within the area, and a potential structure trending ENE, which coincides with the strongest and largest chargeability anomaly. This resistivity high could represent a felsic intrusion, as was observed in outcrop, and the chargeability high could indicate peripheral sulphidation, likely enhanced along the potential structure. The 3D IP Survey has generated multiple drilling targets focusing on the chargeability anomalies within the West Craigmont Zone.The 3D IP Survey at MARB-CAS provided valuable information regarding the lithologies and appears to clearly delineate the contact between Nicola Group rocks and the Guichon Creek Batholith. The major chargeability anomalies are primarily confined within the Nicola Group rocks in the southern portion of the survey area, with some chargeability anomalies detected between the MARB and CAS MINFILE showings.Peter Espig, Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"The 3D IP Survey both confirmed and further defined key targets. Combining numerous geological and geophysical parameters, including bedrock mapping, airborne magnetic survey, and ZTEM survey with the 3D IP Survey gives us a great confidence to have a successful Program.\"A total of 5,000 m of core drilling is planned for the 2024 exploration program. Drilling will primarily be focused on the West Craigmont Zone initially, with the possibility of also drilling at MARB/CAS later in the summer (Figure 2).
