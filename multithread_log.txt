GoldSilverBase MetalsCritical Metals    Source: Couloir Capital (7/3/24)   Metallic Minerals Corp. (MMG:TSX.V; MMNGF:OTCQB) recently announced its maiden NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate (MRE) at the Keno Silver project and the initiation of its 2024 drilling program, according to a Couloir Capital report.    Couloir Capital, in a research report published on June 29, 2024, provided an update on Metallic Minerals Corp. (MMG:TSX.V; MMNGF:OTCQB) following the company's announcement of its maiden NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate (MRE) at the Keno Silver project and the initiation of its 2024 drilling program. Metallic Minerals announced its first NI 43-101 MRE at the Keno Silver project, comprising four separate deposits (Formo, Fox, Caribou, and Homestake). \"The resource comprises an inferred resource of 2.5 Mt at 223 [grams per tonne silver equivalent] g/t AgEq, equating to 18.16 Moz of contained AgEq,\" Couloir Capital noted. \"These deposits remain open to lateral and depth expansion. We expect further drilling to add more resources, which should lead to an increase in the valuation.\" The analysts highlighted the company's 2024 drilling program, which has been initiated at both the La Plata and Keno Silver projects. \"This drilling initiative seeks to expand existing resources and evaluate the potential for new discoveries at the highest-priority, drill-ready targets,\" they stated. At Keno Silver, the focus will be on resource expansion at the Formo target, while at La Plata, the initial focus is on extending higher-grade mineralization at the Allard resource area. Couloir Capital also noted the recent top-up financing from  Newmont Corp. (NEM:NYSE) , viewing it as a positive development. \"We are encouraged to see additional share purchases from Newmont Corp. Newmont exercised its 'top-up right' to buy additional shares of MMG to maintain its 9.5% stake in the company,\" the analysts commented. \"We see this as a vote of confidence by a tier-1 miner in MMG's resource potential.\" Couloir Capital's fair value per share estimate of Blackwolf was updated to CA$0.47, representing a projected upside of 61.08% from the price at the time of the report of CA$0.29. Metallic Minerals' strategic plans include continuing exploration and resource expansion at both the Keno Silver and La Plata projects, as well as earning royalty monies on alluvial gold claims at its Australia Creek property near Dawson City, Yukon. With a Buy rating and a fair value estimate of CA$0.47, Couloir Capital sees significant potential in Metallic Minerals as the company advances its exploration projects and continues to expand its resource base. The analysts expect the 2024 drilling program to \"add significant ounces to the existing resources,\" potentially driving further value for shareholders.

The three new island rigs will operate on existing and newly constructed innovative artificial islands at the offshore Zakum field for drilling and completion of wells. The rigs, which will be constructed by Honghua Group (HH), will incorporate industry leading technology and automation. Delivery of the rigs and commencement of operations is expected during 2026. The rigs will be designed and built as part of a partnership between ADNOC Drilling and HH. This partnership has been specifically formed to harness the transformative nature of AI, digitization, and advanced technology in the design and operation of these next generation drilling rigs. ADNOC Drilling and HH will look to also collaborate with AIQ, an Abu Dhabi based artificial intelligence (AI) pioneer contributing to the energy sector globally. The design of the rig operating systems will look to utilize real-time condition, performance and utilization data to create actionable insights, enhancing rig performance and increasing efficiency, leading to improvements in safety and well delivery times. Additionally, drilling operations on ADNOC's innovative artificial islands create the ideal conditions for extended reach drilling (ERD) with the top five longest wells in the world being delivered from these islands off the coast of Abu Dhabi, the most recently delivered being over 52,000 feet.  The rigs will be built to deliver ERD as well as having the state-of-the-art capability of walking between wells eliminating the need for the rigs to be dismantled to be moved. These capabilities dramatically improve efficiency and safety while vastly reducing costs and emissions. The ADNOC Drilling fleet is now expected to total at least 148 by 2026, including these three new rigs, as well as the previously announced three land rigs for the initial phase of unconventional development. Abdulrahman Abdulla Al Seiari, Chief Executive Officer of ADNOC Drilling, said, \"ADNOC Drilling is honored to receive this substantial award, which marks a significant milestone in our company's accelerated growth journey. These new island rigs will be the most advanced in the world, embracing artificial intelligence, the most transformative technology of our generation. \"Our partnership with HH will amplify the creativity and ingenuity of our industry as we design and build these rigs of the future that drive efficiency and safety and deliver exceptional value for our customer ADNOC Offshore.\" Commenting on the award, Tayba Abdul Rahim Al Hashemi, Chief Executive Officer of ADNOC Offshore, said: \"ADNOC Drilling's technical expertise and enhanced capabilities are key enablers as we safely and sustainably accelerate to meet the world's growing energy demands. This award will strengthen our partnership in the future as we work together to harness AI and innovation to maximise energy, minimize emissions and unlock significant value for stakeholders.\"                   (c)2024 World Oil, (c) 2024 Gulf Publishing Company LLC.market data is provided by Barchart Solutions.

    "Content": "   Federal Bills Call for Damaging Funding Cuts and Harmful Offshore Drilling                                       Skip to content (press enter)           07.02.24   Federal Bills Call for Damaging Funding Cuts and Harmful Offshore Drilling   By Katie Day              Each year, Congress must draft and agree upon a budget to fund the federal government. The intent of these appropriation bills is to provide funding that federal agencies need to accomplish their mandates and fund important programs. However, the first round of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 budget bills to pass out of House Committees last week are riddled with extensive budget cuts to ocean and coastal management programs that the public rely on for clean water and healthy beaches. The bills also include harmful policy provisions, known as \"policy riders\", that have no business being in a budget bill!  Some of the most concerning policy riders in the House Fiscal Year 2025 budget bills include  mandates for new oil and gas leasing, prohibitions on the establishment of important protected areas for wildlife and natural ecosystems , and  limitations that hinder federal agency ability to regulate polluters ; putting water quality, air quality, and the climate at risk. For decades, Surfrider has fought to protect annual funding levels for important ocean and coastal programs. These include programs to support ocean research, protect ocean and coastal habitats, help communities prepare for coastal hazards, test water quality to keep people safe at the beach, and more. Two of the key federal agencies that administer these programs are the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), yet the House budget bills call for a  20 percent funding cut to the EPA , and a  12 percent funding cut to NOAA . While this is a very concerning way to start off the 2025 appropriations process, all is not lost.   Your voice can make a difference!   Click here to contact your federal representatives  and urge them to oppose these funding cuts and dangerous policy riders in order to protect communities, wildlife, the environment, and our ocean and coasts!  FY 2025 House Appropriation Bills: The Bad   Coastal water quality at risk to more sewage spills.  Funding levels for each program administered by the EPA have yet to be released, but a reduction in topline funding of 20 percent (not accounting for inflation!) does not bode well for EPA programs that are critical for protecting water quality, coastlines, and beachgoers in light of increasing climate change impacts. For instance, the  Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations bill  allocates just $1.2 billion to the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, roughly one third of the authorized level. Accounting for the hefty earmarks to specific projects, that's just $649 million to the actual fund, which is a  critical EPA program  that states rely on to fund wastewater infrastructure upgrades in order to prevent sewage spills.    Ocean ecosystems, community resilience, and coastal hazard preparedness threatened.  The  Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations bill  cuts funding to NOAA by 12 percent. While we don't have all the details of funding levels for each NOAA-administered program just yet, a notable topline funding cut means important programs like Coastal Zone Management, Sea Grant, Marine Sanctuaries and Protected Areas, and more could be at risk. These programs are designed to fund ocean and coastal research that keep communities safe, enhance coastal resilience, and help prepare against severe weather events.    Marine wildlife and coastal communities exposed to dangerous offshore oil and gas drilling.   Offshore oil and gas drilling  exacerbates climate change by producing fossil fuels, pollutes coastal waters with heavy metals and chemicals, and ultimately results in heart-wrenching oil spills that harm marine wildlife and coastal communities. The Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations bill includes requirements for new oil and gas lease sales and limits much needed protections for marine mammals from harm caused by offshore energy leasing.    Protections limited for at risk wildlife and ecosystems.  The Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations bill stops the Biden Administration's effort to protect 30 percent of our nation's lands and waters by 2030, known as the 30x30 Initiative, and weakens the Endangered Species Act.    The nation's ability to regulate polluters and respond to the climate crisis hindered.  The Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations bill blocks the EPA from enforcing the recently established methane fee on fossil fuel producers and prevents federal agencies from accounting for climate change impacts by blocking the use of the Social Cost of Carbon in cost benefit analyses. The bill also removes the ability of the National Environmental Protection Act to require the consideration of climate change efforts in permitting. Finally, the bill minimizes the ability of agencies to oversee and limit pollution from chemical and pesticide manufacturers.    National environmental justice initiatives blocked.  The Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations bill defunds important environmental justice programs, including the American Climate Corps, Climate Justice Alliance, and eco grief counseling. The bill also prohibits the Biden Administration's executive orders on diversity, equity, and inclusion from being implemented.   FY 2025 House Appropriation Bills: The Hopeful   Funding to address to the Tijuana River Valley water quality and environmental justice crisis.  The  State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations bill  includes record funding for the International Boundary and Water Commission, which will support essential maintenance and infrastructure upgrades at the International Wastewater Treatment plant at the US/Mexico border. This is a  priority campaign  for the Surfrider Foundation and our San Diego Chapter.    Full funding to the Land and Water Conservation Fund . While permanent, full funding to the Land and Water Conservation Fund is required thanks to the Great Americans Outdoors Act (a bill  Surfrider helped pass  in 2020!), last year millions of dollars were \"rescinded\" from the program during the appropriations process. We're grateful to see House Committee members include full funding to this important program.    There are still many steps to go before becoming final!  These bills have only passed their various House Committees. Each of these appropriation bills will also need to be voted on by the full House of Representatives and confer with the Senate before the budget is finalized. The Senate versions are still in development but are expected to be more protective of funding levels and not include these harmful policy riders.    The fight isn't over.  Surfrider will continue to fight back to get funding levels restored for critical ocean and coastal programs in the Fiscal Year 2025 budget. Surfrider will also work diligently to prevent these harmful policy riders from becoming law.   Surfrider will continue to advocate for federal protections, funding and support for our ocean and coasts.  From  hosting fly-ins to Washington, D.C . to arranging in district field visits so Congressmembers and their staff can see the issues first hand, to submitting testimony to Congressional Committees throughout the year; Surfrider will not stop until these funding levels are restored and dangerous policies are avoided.  Not a Surfrider member? Become one today and join the movement!       ",

**Title**: Federal Bills Call for Damaging Funding Cuts and Harmful Offshore Drilling - Surfrider Foundation
**Summary**: Each year, Congress must draft and agree upon a budget to fund the federal government. The intent of these appropriation bills is to provide funding that federal agencies need to accomplish their mandates and fund important programs. However, the first round of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 budget bills to pass out of House Committees last week are riddled with extensive budget cuts to ocean and coastal management programs that the public rely on for clean water and healthy beaches. The bills also include harmful policy provisions, known as "policy riders", that have no business being in a budget bill! Some of the most concerning policy riders in the House Fiscal Year 2025 budget bills include mandates for new oil and gas leasing, prohibitions on the establishment of important protected areas for wildlife and natural ecosystems, and limitations that hinder federal agency ability to regulate polluters; putting water quality, air quality, and the climate at risk. For decades, Surfrider has fought to protect annual funding levels for important ocean and coastal programs. These include programs to support ocean research, protect ocean and coastal habitats, help communities prepare for coastal hazards, test water quality to keep people safe at the beach, and more. Two of the key federal agencies that administer these programs are the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), yet the House budget bills call for a 20 percent funding cut to the EPA, and a 12 percent funding cut to NOAA. While this is a very concerning way to start off the 2025 appropriations process, all is not lost. Your voice can make a difference! Click here to contact your federal representatives and urge them to oppose these funding cuts and dangerous policy riders in order to protect communities, wildlife, the environment, and our ocean and coasts! FY 2025 House Appropriation Bills: The Bad Coastal water quality at risk to more sewage spills. Funding levels for each program administered by the EPA have yet to be released, but a reduction in topline funding of 20 percent (not accounting for inflation!) does not bode well for EPA programs that are critical for protecting water quality, coastlines, and beachgoers in light of increasing climate change impacts. For instance, the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations bill allocates just $1.2 billion to the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, roughly one third of the authorized level. Accounting for the hefty earmarks to specific projects, that's just $649 million to the actual fund, which is a critical EPA program that states rely on to fund wastewater infrastructure upgrades in order to prevent sewage spills. Ocean ecosystems, community resilience, and coastal hazard preparedness threatened. The Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations bill cuts funding to NOAA by 12 percent. While we don't have all the details of funding levels for each NOAA-administered program just yet, a notable topline funding cut means important programs like Coastal Zone Management, Sea Grant, Marine Sanctuaries and Protected Areas, and more could be at risk. These programs are designed to fund ocean and coastal research that keep communities safe, enhance coastal resilience, and help prepare against severe weather events. Marine wildlife and coastal communities exposed to dangerous offshore oil and gas drilling. Offshore oil and gas drilling exacerbates climate change by producing fossil fuels, pollutes coastal waters with heavy metals and chemicals, and ultimately results in heart-wrenching oil spills that harm marine wildlife and coastal communities. The Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations bill includes requirements for new oil and gas lease sales and limits much needed protections for marine mammals from harm caused by offshore energy leasing. Protections limited for at risk wildlife and ecosystems. The Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations bill stops the Biden Administration's effort to protect 30 percent of our nation's lands and waters by 2030, known as the 30x30 Initiative, and weakens the Endangered Species Act. The nation's ability to regulate polluters and respond to the climate crisis hindered. The Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations bill blocks the EPA from enforcing the recently established methane fee on fossil fuel producers and prevents federal agencies from accounting for climate change impacts by blocking the use of the Social Cost of Carbon in cost benefit analyses. The bill also removes the ability of the National Environmental Protection Act to require the consideration of climate change efforts in permitting. Finally, the bill minimizes the ability of agencies to oversee and limit pollution from chemical and pesticide manufacturers. National environmental justice initiatives blocked. The Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations bill defunds important environmental justice programs, including the American Climate Corps, Climate Justice Alliance, and eco grief counseling. The bill also prohibits the Biden Administration's executive orders on diversity, equity, and inclusion from being implemented. FY 2025 House Appropriation Bills: The Hopeful Funding to address to the Tijuana River Valley water quality and environmental justice crisis. The State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations bill includes record funding for the International Boundary and Water Commission, which will support essential maintenance and infrastructure upgrades at the International Wastewater Treatment plant at the US/Mexico border. This is a priority campaign for the Surfrider Foundation and our San Diego Chapter. Full funding to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. While permanent, full funding to the Land and Water Conservation Fund is required thanks to the Great Americans Outdoors Act (a bill Surfrider helped pass in 2020!), last year millions of dollars were "rescinded" from the program during the appropriations process. We're grateful to see House Committee members include full funding to this important program. There are still many steps to go before becoming final! These bills have only passed their various House Committees. Each of these appropriation bills will also need to be voted on by the full House of Representatives and confer with the Senate before the budget is finalized. The Senate versions are still in development but are expected to be more protective of funding levels and not include these harmful policy riders. The fight isn't over. Surfrider will continue to fight back to get funding levels restored for critical ocean and coastal programs in the Fiscal Year 2025 budget. Surfrider will also work diligently to prevent these harmful policy riders from becoming law. Surfrider will continue to advocate for federal protections, funding and support for our ocean and coasts. From hosting fly-ins to Washington, D.C. to arranging in district field visits so Congressmembers and their staff can see the issues first hand, to submitting testimony to Congressional Committees throughout the year; Surfrider will not stop until these funding levels are restored and dangerous policies are avoided. Not a Surfrider member? Become one today and join the movement!

The Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations bill blocks the EPA from enforcing the recently established methane fee on fossil fuel producers and prevents federal agencies from accounting for climate change impacts by blocking the use of the Social Cost of Carbon in cost benefit analyses. The bill also removes the ability of the National Environmental Protection Act to require the consideration of climate change efforts in permitting. Finally, the bill minimizes the ability of agencies to oversee and limit pollution from chemical and pesticide manufacturers.

National environmental justice initiatives blocked. The Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations bill defunds important environmental justice programs, including the American Climate Corps, Climate Justice Alliance, and eco grief counseling. The bill also prohibits the Biden Administration's executive orders on diversity, equity, and inclusion from being implemented.

FY 2025 House Appropriation Bills: The Hopeful

Funding to address to the Tijuana River Valley water quality and environmental justice crisis. The State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations bill includes record funding for the International Boundary and Water Commission, which will support essential maintenance and infrastructure upgrades at the International Wastewater Treatment plant at the US/Mexico border. This is a priority campaign for the Surfrider Foundation and our San Diego Chapter.

Full funding to the Land and Water Conservation Fund. While permanent, full funding to the Land and Water Conservation Fund is required thanks to the Great Americans Outdoors Act (a bill Surfrider helped pass in 2020!), last year millions of dollars were "rescinded" from the program during the appropriations process. We're grateful to see House Committee members include full funding to this important program.

There are still many steps to go before becoming final! These bills have only passed their various House Committees. Each of these appropriation bills will also need to be voted on by the full House of Representatives and confer with the Senate before the budget is finalized. The Senate versions are still in development but are expected to be more protective of funding levels and not include these harmful policy riders. The fight isn't over. Surfrider will continue to fight back to get funding levels restored for critical ocean and coastal programs in the Fiscal Year 2025 budget. Surfrider will also work diligently to prevent these harmful policy riders from becoming law. Surfrider will continue to advocate for federal protections, funding and support for our ocean and coasts. From hosting fly-ins to Washington, D.C. to arranging in district field visits so Congressmembers and their staff can see the issues first hand, to submitting testimony to Congressional Committees throughout the year; Surfrider will not stop until these funding levels are restored and dangerous policies are avoided.
