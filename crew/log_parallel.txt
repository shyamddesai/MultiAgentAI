The three new island rigs will operate on existing and newly constructed innovative artificial islands at the offshore Zakum field for drilling and completion of wells. The rigs, which will be constructed by Honghua Group (HH), will incorporate industry leading technology and automation. Delivery of the rigs and commencement of operations is expected during 2026. The rigs will be designed and built as part of a partnership between ADNOC Drilling and HH. This partnership has been specifically formed to harness the transformative nature of AI, digitization, and advanced technology in the design and operation of these next generation drilling rigs. ADNOC Drilling and HH will look to also collaborate with AIQ, an Abu Dhabi based artificial intelligence (AI) pioneer contributing to the energy sector globally. The design of the rig operating systems will look to utilize real-time condition, performance and utilization data to create actionable insights, enhancing rig performance and increasing efficiency, leading to improvements in safety and well delivery times. Additionally, drilling operations on ADNOC\u2019s innovative artificial islands create the ideal conditions for extended reach drilling (ERD) with the top five longest wells in the world being delivered from these islands off the coast of Abu Dhabi, the most recently delivered being over 52,000 feet.  The rigs will be built to deliver ERD as well as having the state-of-the-art capability of walking between wells eliminating the need for the rigs to be dismantled to be moved. These capabilities dramatically improve efficiency and safety while vastly reducing costs and emissions. The ADNOC Drilling fleet is now expected to total at least 148 by 2026, including these three new rigs, as well as the previously announced three land rigs for the initial phase of unconventional development. Abdulrahman Abdulla Al Seiari, Chief Executive Officer of ADNOC Drilling, said, \u201cADNOC Drilling is honored to receive this substantial award, which marks a significant milestone in our company\u2019s accelerated growth journey. These new island rigs will be the most advanced in the world, embracing artificial intelligence, the most transformative technology of our generation. \u201cOur partnership with HH will amplify the creativity and ingenuity of our industry as we design and build these rigs of the future that drive efficiency and safety and deliver exceptional value for our customer ADNOC Offshore.\u201d Commenting on the award, Tayba Abdul Rahim Al Hashemi, Chief Executive Officer of ADNOC Offshore, said: \u201cADNOC Drilling\u2019s technical expertise and enhanced capabilities are key enablers as we safely and sustainably accelerate to meet the world\u2019s growing energy demands. This award will strengthen our partnership in the future as we work together to harness AI and innovation to maximise energy, minimize emissions and unlock significant value for stakeholders.\u201d                   \u00a92024 World Oil, \u00a9 2024 Gulf Publishing Company LLC.

The coalition stressed that the government\u2019s previous decision to halt consideration of these renewals sends a clear message that The Bahamas is shifting away from fossil fuels and embracing a sustainable energy future. Challenger Energy Group, formerly known as The Bahamas Petroleum Company (BPC), continues its efforts to secure the renewal of its licenses for a third three-year exploration period. The company is currently engaged in ongoing discussions with the Government regarding the renewal terms. Eytan Uliel, Chief Executive of Challenger Energy, noted in the company\u2019s 2023 annual report and financial statement: \u201cIn relation to the Company\u2019s licenses in The Bahamas, throughout 2023 we continued to pursue a renewal of the licenses into a third exploration period. In parallel, we explored various alternative strategies to monetize those assets. The process has been frustratingly slow, but we expect to make better progress in the coming 12 months.\u201d The report also noted that under its Bahamian exploration licenses, the company must pay the government in advance for annual rentals in the licensed areas. Following the Environmental Authorization for the Perseverance-1 well on February 27, 2020, discussions between the company and the Government of The Bahamas seeking a final agreement on the amount of license fees payable for the remainder of the second exploration period (including the extension due to force majeure) have lacked substantive progress to date. \u201cThe fact that the government has not renewed or considered these licenses is a positive indication that The Bahamas is looking toward a cleaner, greener future,\u201d said Andurah Daxon, Executive Director of Waterkeepers Bahamas. \u201cWe cannot afford to jeopardize our marine environment and coastal ecosystems for uncertain oil prospects.\u201d Earlier this year, OIOF commissioned a nationwide poll revealing overwhelming public support for a permanent ban on oil drilling in Bahamian waters. The extensive survey showed that 86 percent of respondents support legislative action to prevent further fossil fuel exploration, with 74 percent advocating for a transition to renewable energy. Of the more than 400 respondents, only four percent opposed a ban on oil drilling, and nine percent were undecided. \u201cThe Bahamian people have spoken loud and clear. They want to protect our pristine waters and vibrant marine life, which are the lifeblood of our tourism and fishing industries,\u201d said Casuarina McKinney-Lambert, Executive Director of the Bahamas Reef Environment Educational Foundation (BREEF). \u201cThe path forward for the Bahamas is not through fossil fuels but through sustainable energy solutions. The recent oil spill off Clifton underscores the urgency to clean up existing sources of marine pollution and transition to a renewable future.\u201d According to OIOF, the exploration licenses referenced in Challenger Energy Group\u2019s 2023 annual report expired in 2021, and based on available information, the company still owes government fees associated with those licenses. Therefore, the groups emphasize that it is dangerously misleading to state, \u201cChallenger Energy holds four exploration licenses offshore in The Bahamas.\u201d This discrepancy further underscores the need for the government to take decisive action and permanently deny these renewal requests. \u201cThe government\u2019s refusal to consider renewal based on non-payment of license fees was an important step, and three years have now gone by since those licenses expired,\u201d said Chris Wilke of Waterkeeper Alliance. \u201cWith Challenger still knocking at the door, a permanent ban on oil drilling would provide the strongest possible assurance of the Bahamian commitment to safeguarding the marine environment and embracing a clean energy future.\u201d OIOF asserts that The Bahamas has a unique opportunity to lead the Caribbean region to reject dirty fossil fuel proliferation, transition to renewable energy, and set an example for sustainable development and environmental stewardship. OIOF urges the government to prioritize the long-term health and prosperity of the nation by formally denying exploration renewal requests, rejecting any further oil exploration licenses, and committing to a future powered by clean, renewable energy.
